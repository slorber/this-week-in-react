Salut à tous !

La semaine a été très chargée pour nous 😄. La conférence React n'a pas déçu ! Nous n'y étions pas, mais [notre flyer y était](https://x.com/sebastienlorber/status/1790771155734839313) 😇. Non seulement nous avons eu de belles annonces de conf (notamment le compilateur !), mais nous avons eu de beaux articles de la communauté que j'ai dû reporter à la semaine prochaine pour certains d'entre eux.

Bien qu'il soit peu probable que cela se calme car 2 confs majeures commencent demain :

- Vercel Ship, durant laquelle [Next.js 15 devrait être annoncé](https://x.com/feedthejim/status/1792969159321723244) avec une stratégie de cache moins agressive, Turborepo en développement, la prise en charge du compilateur et plus encore.
- App.js Conf, avec également de grandes annonces pour React Native.

Bonne lecture et à la semaine prochaine !

*   🗓 [Chain React Conf](https://chainreactconf.com/?utm_source=thisweekinreact) -  Portland, OR - Du 17 au 19 juillet. La conférence américaine React Native est de retour avec des conférences captivantes et des ateliers pratiques ! Bénéficiez de 15% de réduction sur votre billet avec le code « TWIR »

[![React Conf 2024 Recap](/emails/issues/186/recap.jpg)](https://react.dev/blog/2024/05/22/react-conf-2024-recap)

**[React Conf 2024 Recap](https://react.dev/blog/2024/05/22/react-conf-2024-recap)**

L'équipe React a publié un article de blog récapitulatif de la React Conf, juste à temps pour la newsletter d'aujourd'hui 🤗. Il présente tous les conférences et les principales annonces. Je ne les ai pas encore toutes vues, mais mes points forts pour l'instant sont :

- React 19 est en RC, et une version stable est attendue dans les prochaines semaines
- Le compilateur React est sorti et semble vraiment puissant
- Les Universal React Server Components arrivent sur Expo et la démo est vraiment impressionnante
- Remix et React Router fusionnent. Remix v3 sera finalement React Router v7.
- La démo Real-time React Server Components rend les RSC stateful et ouvre de nouvelles possibilités qui me rappellent Phoenix LiveView
- React coordonne maintenant les balises HTML, ce qui est extrêmement sous-estimé.

Encore une fois, il ne s'agit que de mes favoris personnels. Nous avons déjà couvert la plupart des fonctionnalités de React 19 dans la newsletter, et [l'article du blog de React 19 beta](https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19) reste la référence pour découvrir toutes les nouvelles fonctionnalités à venir dans la prochaine version majeure.

[![React Compiler](/emails/issues/186/compiler.jpg)](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler)

**[The React Compiler is out](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler)**

The compiler probably deserves its own section right. TLDR: the compiler optimizes your existing code automatically and gives you fine-grained reactivity using regular JS values. Try the [React Compiler Playground](https://playground.react.dev/#N4Igzg9grgTgxgUxALhAgHgBwjALgAgBMEAzAQygBsCSoA7OXASwjvwFkBPAQU0wAoAlPmAAdNvhgJcsNgB5CTAG4A+ABIJKlCPgDqOSoTkB6RaoDc4gL7iQVoA) to see how it works, and understand how it optimizes your code.

It has been successfully rolled out on Instagram web with great results (2.5x faster interactions). It statically analyses your code, one file at a time, and memoizes what can safely be optimized, with even greater granularity than you could do by hand. If you follow the Rules of React, you shouldn’t need to rewrite any code. The ESLint plugin tells you about problematic code that the compiler detects. It does not play well with proxy-based solutions like MobX. Configuration options and opt-in/out directives enable you to try the compiler gradually on your codebase.

The compiler is initially written in TypeScript and ships with Babel bindings, but don’t be disappointed because its logic is decoupled. Support for SWC should come next, and we’ll probably have a port in Rust a bit later (they already made a POC for that to ensure it’s feasible).

It is worth mentioning that the React team always had in mind to have a compiler for React (see [Andrew Clark’s thread](https://x.com/acdlite/status/1792710362745405911)). And this is only the beginning, they now have the infrastructure to build even more powerful things. I’m pretty sure sooner or later we won’t need anymore a dependency array, and that the compiler will be able to optimize fine-grained context consumption ([relevant tweet](https://x.com/TkDodo/status/1741193371283026422)).

- 📜 [React Compiler With React 18](https://jherr2020.medium.com/react-compiler-with-react-18-1e39f60ae71a): The compiler is not a React 19 feature. Jack shows a POC of using it under React 18 by providing a very simple compiler runtime hook. Lauren from the React Compiler team just confirmed it’s ok to do so and provided an [official polyfill](https://github.com/reactwg/react-compiler/discussions/6) that you can use temporarily, although it’s recommended to upgrade to React 19.

[![Merging Remix and React Router](/emails/issues/186/remix.jpg)](https://remix.run/blog/merging-remix-and-react-router)

**[Merging Remix and React Router](https://remix.run/blog/merging-remix-and-react-router)**

This is another big announcement from React Conf. Remix and React Router have converged so much (thanks to the Vite plugin and SPA mode) that it doesn’t really make sense anymore to keep both. Technically, instead of shipping Remix v3, they plan to add an optional Vite plugin to React Router v7, which will remain retro-compatible, and also bring new features (RSC, server-actions, static pre-rendering…). See also the follow-up post [Incremental Path to React 19: React Conf Follow-Up](https://remix.run/blog/incremental-path-to-react-19).

- 📜 [React 19 lets you write impossible components](https://www.mux.com/blog/react-19-server-components-and-actions): A great article from Mux that adopted RSCs early, explaining that we only scratched the surface of the new patterns RSCs enable. The changelog pagination example is cool and shows that even libraries like React Query might become less useful.
- 📜 [Introducing Pigment CSS: the next generation of CSS-in-JS](https://mui.com/blog/introducing-pigment-css/): the MUI team explains the motivations to create their own in-house CSS-in-JS solution, built on top of the WyW-in-JS toolkit, that should power MUI v6 later this year. It is compatible with RSCs. The adoption for MUI/Emotion/StyledComponent users should be easy.
- 📜 [Digging for SSRF in NextJS apps](https://www.assetnote.io/resources/research/digging-for-ssrf-in-nextjs-apps): Security researchers explain blind Server Side Request Forgery vulnerabilities they found in Next.js related to the Image component and Server Actions implementations. Those vulnerabilities have been patched since Next.js 14.1.1 already (January 2024).
- 📜 [Prefer Multiple Compositions](https://kyleshevlin.com/prefer-multiple-compositions/): If your component has a finite set of cases to handle, it will be more maintainable to have clear separate if/else branches for each cases rather than spreading conditionals everywhere in JSX.
- 📜 [Prefer Noun-Adjective Naming](https://kyleshevlin.com/prefer-noun-adjective-naming/): I also prefer to name a component “ButtonPrimary” instead of “PrimaryButton”. Related things remain grouped alphabetically, and are easier to lookup in the IDE.
- 📜 [Inline Styles on Steroids](https://weser.io/blog/inline-styles-on-steroids): With projects such as CSS Hooks, and the web platform planning to add support for inline style nesting, it’s only a matter of time until inline styles make a huge comeback. The author of Fela recreates the DX of a good CSS-in-JS library on top of CSS Hooks thanks to 2 new projects he’s working on.
- 📜 [Quantifying the Impact of Styled Components on Server Response Times](https://blog.levineandrew.com/quantifying-the-impact-of-styled-components-on-server-response-times): Uses SpeedScope (more powerful than Chrome DevTools) to analyze a CPU trace and concludes that style injection takes 47% of SSR time.
- 📜 [Storybook - Portable stories for Playwright Component Tests](https://storybook.js.org/blog/portable-stories-for-playwright-ct/): Although Storybook provides a play() function using a Playwright test runner, you might still want to use Playwright Component testing directly, and reuse your existing stories there.
- 📜 [Deploying Remix to Cloudflare with SST](https://ruanmartinelli.com/blog/remix-sst-cloudflare): Using SST to deploy your app to a major cloud can be a nice alternative to DX platforms like Vercel/Netlify. TIL that it’s so simple to use, and it also supports deploying to Cloudflare.
- 📦 [Restyle](https://reactstyle.vercel.app/): New CSS-in-JS library compatible with RSC that’s leveraging the brand-new style hoisting and deduplication feature of React 19. Those new React primitives were also designed with CSS-in-JS libs in mind, and it’s great to see the community already leveraging them. It’s also interesting for distributing CSS as part of a React library npm package.
- 📦 [React Google Maps 1.0](https://mapsplatform.google.com/resources/blog/google-maps-platform-graduates-react-integration-library-to-1-0/): The official Google Maps library for React is now stable, maintained by the OpenJS Foundation.
- 📦 [Million Lint 1.0-rc](https://million.dev/blog/lint-rc): IDE extension that automatically finds and fixes performance issues for you. Unlike the React compiler, it is based on runtime analysis and can detect additional performance problems that the compiler can’t. Both can be used in tandem.
- 📦 [Zustand 5.0-beta - Upgrade guide available - drop deprecated features, upgrades React/TS](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand/blob/v5/docs/guides/migrating-to-v5.mdx)

React Conf is officially behind us, and I hope you had a chance to look at the recordings of the awesome presentations on YouTube. My biggest meta-takeaway was just how much RN content there was in the conference! As RN is very much developed out in the open and in collaboration with the whole community, there were no surprising “big announcements,” but it was a very good summary of the current state of RN and an outlook on the road ahead. The most impressive and inspiring part for me was Evan Bacon’s vision for Universal React Server Components, which he presented using an absolute killer demo that I’m urging you to [watch for yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TZQ6k4SLE&t=20765s). I’ve put my main takeaways into some bullet points for you:

- RN is thriving: Over 2M weekly downloads of RN now, 30 shipped versions of RN in 2024 so far
- The new Architecture is now in Beta
- Expo is now officially recommended for all new apps
- New reactnative.dev landing page launched
- React Conf app is open source
- Expo’s vision for Universal RSC
