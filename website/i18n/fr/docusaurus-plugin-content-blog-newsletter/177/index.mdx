[![Refine - Open source Retool Alternative](/emails/issues/177/refine.jpg)](https://github.com/refinedev/refine)

**[Refine - Open source Retool Alternative](https://github.com/refinedev/refine)**

The sweet spot between the low code and traditional development for CRUD-heavy applications.

As an open-source React meta-framework designed for Enterprise applications, [Refine](https://github.com/refinedev/refine) offers a headless solution ideal for tasks like admin panels, dashboards, and internal tools.

While low-code tools may offer initial promise, they often fall short in handling complex scenarios due to scalability issues, limited customization options, and the risk of vendor lock-in.

Refine enables teams to rapidly develop production-ready apps while maintaining flexibility.
