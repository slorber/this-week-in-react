## Audience

The audience of our [weekly newsletter](/newsletter) is **qualitative and engaged**, with open-rates way above the industry standard.

### 📜 Content

Our editorial line assumes our readers are:
- **React developers**: we cover the whole React ecosystem
- **React-Native** developers: there's a dedicated section in the newsletter
- **experienced**: they know React well and are not interested in beginner-friendly content
- **passionate**: they want to stay on top of their favorite technology
- **open-minded**: they also want to know about non-React news that are relevant to them
- **respecting their time**: they want a content pre-filter instead of scrolling on Twitter

:::info This newsletter is different

This is not a typical weekly React curation newsletter. Instead, it is a weekly curation of news ***for*** React developers.

We focus on what's **really new** in an **exhaustive** way. There's usually **a lof of external links**, but readers aren't expected to click on all of them: simply reading the headlines and comments provide value to them.

We filter heavily content that does not match our editorial line, and generally exclude:
- content produced for SEO reasons based on keyword analysis
- listicles, 101's, verbose step-by-step tutorials
- UI libraries and npm packages
