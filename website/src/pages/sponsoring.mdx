## Audience {#audience}

The audience of our [weekly newsletter](/newsletter) is **qualitative and engaged**, with open-rates way above the industry standard.

### 📜 Content {#content}

Our editorial line assumes our readers are:

- **React developers**: we cover the whole React ecosystem
- **React-Native developers**: there's a dedicated section in the newsletter
- **experienced**: they know React well and are not interested in beginner-friendly content
- **passionate**: they want to stay on top of their favorite technology
- **open-minded**: they also want to know about non-React news that are relevant to them
- **respecting their time**: they want a content pre-filter instead of scrolling on Twitter

:::info This newsletter is different

This is not a typical weekly React curation newsletter. Instead, it is a weekly curation of news **_for_** React developers.

We focus on what's **really new** in an **exhaustive** way. There's usually **a lof of external links**, but readers aren't expected to click all of them: simply reading the headlines and comments usually provide enough value.

We filter heavily content that does not match our editorial line, and generally exclude:

- content produced for SEO, based on keyword analysis
- listicles, 101's, verbose step-by-step tutorials
- most UI libraries and npm packages

### 📈 Stats {#stats}

<br />

:::tip About the open-rate

In practice, the open-rate is likely higher because:

- [iOS 15 prevents email tracking](https://phoscreative.com/articles/ios15-email-marketing/)
- [Gmail long emails clipping prevent tracking pixel load](https://convertkit.com/sender-reputation)
- Popular tools among our audience: [StoopInbox](https://stoopinbox.com/), [Kill The Newsletter](https://kill-the-newsletter.com/), [FeedBin](https://feedbin.com/), [ReadWise](https://readwise.io/), [Feedly](https://feedly.com/), [Newsletterss](https://newsletterss.com/), [Mailbrew](https://mailbrew.com/), [ProtonMail](https://proton.me/), [Apple Private Relay Email](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/sign_in_with_apple/sign_in_with_apple_js/communicating_using_the_private_email_relay_service), [Firefox Relay](https://relay.firefox.com/)...

## FAQ

<details>
  <summary>Why are some dates marked as unavailable</summary>

This newsletter is mostly run by a [single person](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber) who sometimes has to take vacations 😅

I prefer to be pessimistic and open sponsorship slots once I'm sure I will be available.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Are the sponsorship dates contractual?</summary>

The respect of sponsorship dates are a best effort and **not contractual**, unless we sign a contract.

This newsletter is mostly run by a [single person](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber), and unexpected life events can happen.

That can lead to offset the upcoming sponsorship slots. In practice, your dates shouldn't be delayed by more than issue (usually 1 week).

We will let you know if publication dates are postponed, and look for a solution together in case your dates are not flexible.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Do you provide tracking / reporting?</summary>

We don't provide any kind reporting by default: it is a manual and time-consuming process.

To measure the result of your newsletter campaign, we suggest:

- to provide your own tracking links to count clicks: use [bit.ly](https://bit.ly/)!
- to intercept the `utm_` querystring parameters we automatically add to all external links

In the future, we will look into providing a good reporting.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why are prices higher for a single issue?</summary>

To keep a positive ROI, we have to take into account the time it takes to manage sponsors: explanations, booking, invoicing, ad copy reviews, questions...

</details>

<details>
  <summary>
Why is the sponsorship calendar public?
  </summary>

This newsletter is being built in public, in a transparent way:

- The [sponsorship calendar](https://thisweekinreact.com/calendar) is public
- The [Indie Hackers product page](https://thisweekinreact.com/ih) provides monthly reportings on turnover, growth...

In case you don't want your company's name to appear in our public calendar, please give us a company alias name.
