## Audience {#audience}

The audience of our [weekly newsletter](/newsletter) is **qualitative and engaged**, with open-rates way above the industry standard.

### üìú Content {#content}

Our editorial line assumes readers are:

- **React developers**: we cover the whole React ecosystem
- **React-Native developers**: there's a dedicated section in the newsletter
- **experienced**: they know React well and are not interested in beginner-friendly content
- **passionate**: they want to stay on top of their favorite technology
- **open-minded**: they also want to know about non-React news that are relevant to them
- **respecting their time**: they want a pre-filtered qualitative content

<details>
  <summary>What makes this newsletter unique</summary>

It is a weekly curation of news **for** React developers, not just about React. And in particular for **mid/senior** developers that are already productive using React.

We focus on what's **really new** in an **exhaustive** way. There's usually **a lof of external links**, but readers aren't expected to click all of them: simply reading the headlines and comments usually provide enough value.

We **filter content** heavily, and generally exclude:

- content produced for SEO, based on keyword analysis
- listicles, 101's
- verbose step-by-step tutorials
- promotional product tutorials
- most UI libraries and npm packages

## FAQ

<details>
  <summary>Why are some dates unavailable</summary>

This newsletter is mostly run by a [single person](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber) who sometimes has to take vacations üòÖ

I prefer to be pessimistic and open sponsorship slots once I'm sure I will be available.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Are the sponsorship dates contractual?</summary>

The respect of sponsorship dates are a best effort and **not contractual**, unless we sign a contract.

This newsletter is mostly run by a [single person](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber), and unexpected life events can happen.

That can lead to offset the upcoming sponsorship slots. In practice, your dates shouldn't be delayed by more than one issue/week.

We will let you know if publication dates are postponed, and look for a solution together in case your dates are not flexible.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Do you provide tracking / reporting?</summary>

We don't provide any reporting by default, but you can ask for a basic reporting one week after the send.

To measure the result of your newsletter campaign, we suggest:

- to add [`utm_` querystring parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM_parameters) (we automatically add some default utm parameters in case you don't provide them)
- to provide your own tracking links to count clicks (please do not use [bit.ly](https://bit.ly/), it often flag emails as spam on some email clients, we prefer [dub.sh](https://dub.co/) using your own custom domain)

In the future, we will look into providing a good reporting automatically.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why are prices higher for a single issue?</summary>

To keep a positive ROI for us, we have to take into account the time it takes to manage sponsorships: sales, support, booking, invoicing, ad copy reviews, email integration...

</details>

<details>
  <summary>
Why is the sponsorship calendar public?
  </summary>

This newsletter is being built in public, in a transparent way:

- Check our [public spreadsheet](https://thisweekinreact.com/calendar)
- The [Indie Hackers product page](https://thisweekinreact.com/ih) provides monthly reportings on turnover, growth...

In case you don't want your company's name to appear in our public calendar, please give us a company alias name.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        What happens if I don't submit my ad copy on time?
    </summary>

    It is your responsibility to provide the ad copy on time, at least one week before the publication date.

    Unless we have an agreement, it is not possible to cancel a sponsorship slot at the last minute. We will have to run your ad, no matter what.

    In case we don't receive your ad copy on time, we will:
    - use the copy of a previous ad, if possible
    - fallback to a quick-and-dirty ad we create ourselves based on your ad landing page

    For these reasons, we strongly recommend to submit your ad copy on time, including ad updates.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        What happens if my ad gets scheduled the same day as a company I don't like, or a competitor?
    </summary>

    Our newsletter has multiple placements, and it is possible that your ad gets matched with another ad that does not please you.

    We understand that you might not want to broadcast your ad the same newsletter as your competitors. In practice, we think it is not a big deal, and many paid marketing channels (such as Google search ads) display competitors already.

    However, in case there are companies and competitors you absolutely don't want to advertise alongside, we kindly ask you to be proactive and provide us with an exhaustive list of companies you do not want to be matched with.

    If you don't provide such a list when booking a slot, we will do our best to not match you with a competitor on a best-effort basis based on our intuition, but there will be no guarantee.

    Please keep in mind that our sales/booking team doesn't always have perfect knowledge of who's competing with whom, and to what extent. You know better than us whose companies you don't want to be matched with.
