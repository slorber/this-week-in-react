## Audience {#audience}

The audience of our [weekly newsletter](/newsletter) is **qualitative and engaged**, with open-rates way above the industry standard.

### 📜 Content {#content}

Our editorial line assumes our readers are:

- **React developers**: we cover the whole React ecosystem
- **React-Native developers**: there's a dedicated section in the newsletter
- **experienced**: they know React well and are not interested in beginner-friendly content
- **passionate**: they want to stay on top of their favorite technology
- **open-minded**: they also want to know about non-React news that are relevant to them
- **respecting their time**: they want a pre-filtered qualitative content

<details>
  <summary>What makes this newsletter unique</summary>

It is a weekly curation of news **for** React developers, not just about React. And in particular for **mid/senior** developers that are already productive using React.

We focus on what's **really new** in an **exhaustive** way. There's usually **a lof of external links**, but readers aren't expected to click all of them: simply reading the headlines and comments usually provide enough value.

We **filter content** heavily, and generally exclude:

- content produced for SEO, based on keyword analysis
- listicles, 101's
- verbose step-by-step tutorials
- promotional product tutorials
- most UI libraries and npm packages

## FAQ

<details>
  <summary>Why are some dates unavailable</summary>

This newsletter is mostly run by a [single person](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber) who sometimes has to take vacations 😅

I prefer to be pessimistic and open sponsorship slots once I'm sure I will be available.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Are the sponsorship dates contractual?</summary>

The respect of sponsorship dates are a best effort and **not contractual**, unless we sign a contract.

This newsletter is mostly run by a [single person](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber), and unexpected life events can happen.

That can lead to offset the upcoming sponsorship slots. In practice, your dates shouldn't be delayed by more than one issue/week.

We will let you know if publication dates are postponed, and look for a solution together in case your dates are not flexible.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Do you provide tracking / reporting?</summary>

We don't provide any kind reporting by default, but you can ask for a basic reporting one week after the send.

To measure the result of your newsletter campaign, we suggest:

- to provide your own tracking links to count clicks: use [bit.ly](https://bit.ly/)!
- to intercept the `utm_` querystring parameters we automatically add to all external links

In the future, we will look into providing a good reporting automatically.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why are prices higher for a single issue?</summary>

To keep a positive ROI for us, we have to take into account the time it takes to manage sponsorships: sales, support, booking, invoicing, ad copy reviews, email integration...

</details>

<details>
  <summary>
Why is the sponsorship calendar public?
  </summary>

This newsletter is being built in public, in a transparent way:

- The [sponsorship calendar](https://thisweekinreact.com/calendar) is public
- The [Indie Hackers product page](https://thisweekinreact.com/ih) provides monthly reportings on turnover, growth...

In case you don't want your company's name to appear in our public calendar, please give us a company alias name.
