# For conference organizers

Do you want to **promote your event** and **sell extra tickets**?

Our newsletter can be your **media partner** and help you achieve your goals, promoting your event for free to **{newsletterStats.all.subscribersCount} subscribers**

In practice, this means that we **exchange visibility** with our respective audiences as part of a **cross-promotional operation**.

:::tip is this a good fit?

[**This Week In React**](/) is a large newsletter for **mid/senior React and React Native developers** looking to stay up-to-date.

This audience is made up of **passionate and experienced developers**. We believe this partnership is a good fit for both sides:

- Our audience is **likely to buy conference tickets and workshops**
- Your audience is likely to sign up to our newsletter and keep reading it over time

## Conferences we partner with

We prefer to partner with conferences that meet the following criteria:

- The conference is essentially about React and/or React Native
- The conference takes place on site, with over 300 participants
- The conference is taking place in Europe or the United States

If you don't meet all the criteria, don't worry, you can always get in touch with us, and we'll figure this out.

:::info Our previous partners

We already partnered with those conferences:

- [React Summit - Amsterdam](https://reactsummit.com/)
- [React Advanced - London](https://reactadvanced.com/)
- [App.js - KrakÃ³w](https://appjs.co/)
- [React Native EU - WrocÅ‚aw](https://www.react-native.eu/)
- [Chain React - Portland](https://chainreactconf.com/)

- [React Connection - Paris](https://reactconnection.io/)
- [React Native Connection - Paris](https://reactnativeconnection.io/)
- [React Paris](https://react.paris/)

These conferences usually report some **extra ticket sales** attributed to our promo code, and consider this partnership to be worthwhile.

## Partnership execution

Here's how we generally execute this kind of media partnership.

### What we do

- We mention once the conference in the newsletter intro ([example](/newsletter/159))
- We mention it 3 times ([example](/newsletter/159#react)) at key events (early birds, CFP, speakers announcement...)

### What you do

- You print and distribute our [Flyer (A5 leaflet format)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tVoR3u5qERjt9hwyNQQMJzax3iYEKcsL) in the conference bag
- You put our [logo](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1029GIVDLUizLhhz0xNAdDlMnPhsQ3_f7) on your homepage with a do-follow backlink (with `?utm_source=<YOUR_CONF_NAME>`)
- You mention us once in your conference newsletter (with `?utm_source=<YOUR_CONF_NAME>`)
- You offer discount of at least 10% on tickets with promo code `TWIR`, also useful for tracking

### Other options

We are open to negotiating other practices to give you the visibility we both need, such as:

- Social media mentions
- Additional newsletter inclusions
- Creation of a conf summary blog post, that we both distribute
- Anything else that benefit both of us
