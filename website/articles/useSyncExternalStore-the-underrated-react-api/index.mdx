# useSyncExternalStore - The underrated React API

You might have heard of [`useSyncExternalStore()`](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usesyncexternalstore), a new React 18 hook to **subscribe to external data sources**. It is often used internally by state management libraries - like [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/pull/1808) - to implement a **selector system**.

But what about using `useSyncExternalStore()` in your own application code?

In this interactive article, I want to present you a problem: **over-returning React hooks triggering useless re-renders**. We will see how `useSyncExternalStore()` can be a good fix.

## Over-returning hooks

Let's illustrate the problem with [`useLocation()`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/hooks/use-location) from React-Router.

This hook returns an object with many attributes (`pathname`, `hash`, `search`...), but you might not read all of them. Just calling the hook will trigger re-renders when any of these attributes is updated.

Let's consider this app:

```tsx
function CurrentPathname() {
  const { pathname } = useLocation();
  return <div>{pathname}</div>;
}

function CurrentHash() {
  const { hash } = useLocation();
  return <div>{hash}</div>;
}

function Links() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Link to="#link1">#link1</Link>
      <Link to="#link2">#link2</Link>
      <Link to="#link3">#link3</Link>
    </div>
  );
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <CurrentPathname />
      <CurrentHash />
      <Links />
    </div>
  );
}
```

<App />

On any hash link click, the `CurrentPathname` component will re-render, even if it's not even using the `hash` attribute ðŸ˜….

:::tip

Whenever a hook returns data that you don't display, think about React re-renders. If you don't pay attention, a tiny `useLocation()` call added at the top of a React tree could harm your app's performance.

The goal is not to criticize React-Router, but rather to illustrate the problem. `useLocation()` is just a good pragmatic candidate to create this interactive article. Your own React hooks and other third-party libraries might also over-return.

## `useSyncExternalStore` to the rescue?

The [official documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usesyncexternalstore) says:

> useSyncExternalStore is a hook recommended for reading and subscribing from external data sources in a way thatâ€™s compatible with concurrent rendering features like selective hydration and time slicing.
> This method returns the value of the store and accepts three arguments:
>
> - `subscribe`: function to register a callback that is called whenever the store changes.
> - `getSnapshot`: function that returns the current value of the store.
> - `getServerSnapshot`: function that returns the snapshot used during server rendering.

```tsx
function useSyncExternalStore<Snapshot>(
  subscribe: (onStoreChange: () => void) => () => void,
  getSnapshot: () => Snapshot,
  getServerSnapshot?: () => Snapshot,
): Snapshot;
```

This feels a bit abstract. This [beta doc page](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect#subscribing-to-an-external-store) gives a good example:

```tsx
function subscribe(callback) {
  window.addEventListener("online", callback);
  window.addEventListener("offline", callback);
  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener("online", callback);
    window.removeEventListener("offline", callback);
  };
}

function useOnlineStatus() {
  return useSyncExternalStore(
    subscribe,
    () => navigator.onLine,
    () => true,
  );
}

function ChatIndicator() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();
  // ...
}
```

It turns out that the browser history can also be considered as an external data source. Let's see how to use `useSyncExternalStore` with React-Router!

## Implementing `useHistorySelector()`

React-Router expose everything we need to wire `useSyncExternalStore`:

- access the browser history with [`useHistory()`](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/api/Hooks/usehistory)
- subscribe for history updates with [`history.listen(callback)`](https://github.com/remix-run/history/blob/main/docs/api-reference.md#history.listen)
- access a snapshot of the current location with [`history.location`](https://github.com/remix-run/history/blob/main/docs/api-reference.md#historylocation)

:::caution

This website uses React-Router v5: the solution will be different for React-Router v6 ([see](https://twitter.com/Zh0uzi/status/1567523679604539405)).

:::

The implementation of `useHistorySelector()` relatively simple:

```tsx
function useHistorySelector(selector) {
  const history = useHistory();
  return useSyncExternalStore(history.listen, () =>
    selector(history),
  );
}
```

Let's use it in our app:

```tsx
function CurrentPathname() {
  const pathname = useHistorySelector(
    (history) => history.location.pathname,
  );
  return <div>{pathname}</div>;
}

function CurrentHash() {
  const hash = useHistorySelector(
    (history) => history.location.hash,
  );
  return <div>{hash}</div>;
}
```

<AppFixed />

Now, when you click on a hash link above, the `CurrentPathname` component will **not re-render** anymore!

## Another example: `scrollY`

There are so many external data sources that we can subscribe to, and implementing your own selector system on top might enable you to optimize React re-renders.

For example, let's consider we want to use the `scrollY` position of a page. We can implement this custom React hook:

```tsx
// A memoized constant fn prevents unsubscribe/resubscribe
// In practice it is not a big deal
function subscribe(onStoreChange) {
  global.window?.addEventListener("scroll", onStoreChange);
  return () =>
    global.window?.removeEventListener(
      "scroll",
      onStoreChange,
    );
}

function useScrollY(selector = (id) => id) {
  return useSyncExternalStore(
    subscribe,
    () => selector(global.window?.scrollY),
    () => undefined,
  );
}
```

We can now use this hook with an optional selector:

```tsx
function ScrollY() {
  const scrollY = useScrollY();
  return <div>{scrollY}</div>;
}

function ScrollYFloored() {
  const to = 100;
  const scrollYFloored = useScrollY((y) =>
    y ? Math.floor(y / to) * to : undefined,
  );
  return <div>{scrollYFloored}</div>;
}
```

<ScrollApp />

Scroll the page and see how the components above re-render? One is re-rendering less than the other!

:::info

When you don't need a `scrollY` 1 pixel precision level, returning a wide range value such as `scrollY` can also be considered as over-returning. Consider returning a narrower value.

For example: a `useResponsiveBreakpoint()` hook that only returns a limited set of values (`small`, `medium` or `large`) will be more optimized than a `useViewportWidth()` hook.

If a React component only handles `large` screens differently, you can create an even narrower `useIsLargeScreen()` hook returning a boolean.

:::

## Conclusion

I hope this article convinced you to take a second look at `useSyncExternalStore()`. I feel this hook is currently underused in the React ecosystem, and deserves a bit more attention. There are many external data sources that you can subscribe to.

If you still haven't upgraded to React 18, there's a npm [use-sync-external-store](https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-sync-external-store) shim that you can already use today in older versions. There is also a `use-sync-external-store/with-selector` export in case you need to return a memoized non-primitive value.
