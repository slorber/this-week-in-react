**Records & Tuples**, a very interesting **[proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-record-tuple)**, has just reached **[stage 2](https://twitter.com/robpalmer2/status/1286040041089904640)** at **TC39**.

They bring **deeply immutable data structures** to JavaScript.

But don't overlook their **equality properties**, that are <u>**VERY**</u> interesting for **React**.

A whole category of **React bugs** are related to **unstable object identities**:

- **Performance**: re-renders that could be avoided
- **Behavior**: useless effect re-executions, infinite loops
- **API surface**: unability to express when a stable object identity matters

I will explain the basics of **Records & Tuples**, and how they can solve **real world React issues**.
