**[If It’s Slow, It’s Broken 🐢](https://sentry.io/lp/new-apm/?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=paid-community&utm_campaign=perf-fy26q1-evergreen&utm_content=newsletter-primary-slowbug-seehow)**

Bad performance is just another kind of bug 🐛 . And Sentry helps you find bugs fast, even the ones that aren’t obvious.

*   Cut chunks of time off of bad API calls
    
*   Reduce extremely costly, frequently pinged, or generally slow db operations 
    
*   Uncover the source of a traffic spike spike in minutes
    

Whether it’s an error or a slowdown, Sentry helps you fix issues fast and keep your app running smoothly. Because if it’s slow, it’s broken. [See for yourself](https://sentry.io/lp/new-apm/?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=paid-community&utm_campaign=perf-fy26q1-evergreen&utm_content=newsletter-primary-slowbug-seehow).

**[Tests are dead - Meticulous is here](https://www.meticulous.ai?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_campaign=jan15th)**

Meticulous creates and maintains an exhaustive suite of e2e ui tests with **zero** developer effort. 

  
This quote from the CTO of Traba sums the product up best: "Meticulous has fundamentally changed the way we approach frontend testing in our web applications, fully eliminating the need to write any frontend tests. The software gives us confidence that every change will be completely regression tested, allowing us to ship more quickly with significantly fewer bugs in our code. The platform is easy to use and reduces the barrier to entry for backend-focused devs to contribute to our frontend codebase."  
  
Meticulous is used by companies like Lattice, Bilt Rewards, Power and many others.

This [post](https://www.meticulous.ai/blog/lessons-from-a-decade?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_campaign=jan15th) from our CTO sets out the context of why exhaustive testing can double engineering velocity.
