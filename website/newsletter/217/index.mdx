Hi everyone!

This week we continue to notice interesting activity around the upcoming `<ViewTransition>` component.

Expo is finally launching its universal cross-platform hosting solution, and Shopify shared interesting feedback on its usage of React Native.

Bad performance is just another kind of bug 🐛 . And Sentry helps you find bugs fast, even the ones that aren’t obvious.

- Cut chunks of time off of bad API calls
- Reduce extremely costly, frequently pinged, or generally slow db operations
- Uncover the source of a traffic spike spike in minutes

Whether it’s an error or a slowdown, Sentry helps you fix issues fast and keep your app running smoothly. Because if it’s slow, it’s broken.

[![Revealed: React's experimental animations API](/emails/issues/217/viewtransition.jpg)](https://motion.dev/blog/reacts-experimental-view-transition-api)

**[Revealed: React's experimental animations API](https://motion.dev/blog/reacts-experimental-view-transition-api)**

Motion creator explains the animation tradeoffs of using View Transitions and why it makes sense for React to directly integrate it into its reconciler through a new `<ViewTransition>` component. This interactive post shows an early look at the upcoming React feature, including some of its current implementation details, and explains how it overlaps a bit with Motion layout animations.

Keep in mind this exciting new API is still in active development, subject to change, and new PRs keep landing, notably:

- 👀 [React Core PR \- Support only View Transitions v2](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/31996): The new component will leverage recent v2 spec APIs such as `view-transition-class`, requires Safari 18.2+, and still unsupported in Firefox.
- 👀 [React Core PR \- View Transition Class Names based on event kind](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/32050)
- 👀 [Next.js PR \- `experimental.viewTransition` flag](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/74659): You can try the feature in Next.js 15.2 canary 4\.

[![Tests are dead - Meticulous is here](/emails/issues/217/meticulous.jpg)](https://www.meticulous.ai?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_campaign=jan15th)

**[Tests are dead - Meticulous is here](https://www.meticulous.ai?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_campaign=jan15th)**

Meticulous creates and maintains an exhaustive suite of e2e ui tests with **zero** developer effort.

This quote from the CTO of Traba sums the product up best: "Meticulous has fundamentally changed the way we approach frontend testing in our web applications, fully eliminating the need to write any frontend tests. The software gives us confidence that every change will be completely regression tested, allowing us to ship more quickly with significantly fewer bugs in our code. The platform is easy to use and reduces the barrier to entry for backend-focused devs to contribute to our frontend codebase."

Meticulous is used by companies like Lattice, Bilt Rewards, Power and many others.

This [post](https://www.meticulous.ai/blog/lessons-from-a-decade?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_campaign=jan15th) from our CTO sets out the context of why exhaustive testing can double engineering velocity.

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

[![EAS Hosting Preview](/emails/issues/217/easdeploy.jpg)](https://expo.dev/blog/expo-announces-eas-hosting-service)

**[EAS Hosting Preview](https://expo.dev/blog/expo-announces-eas-hosting-service)**

Expo unveiled what we expected, the first-ever universal app-hosting platform that completes the vision of bringing the web DX to the cross-platform world. It enables us to seamlessly deploy Expo’s server-related features, notably Expo for Web, API Routes, and Universal React Server Components. It takes into account mobile app subtleties, such as syncing the backend/app versions. You can use either the CLI or CI (EAS Workflows). Under the hood, it’s using Cloudflare Workers. There’s a free plan.

[![Five years of React Native at Shopify](/emails/issues/217/shopify.jpg)](https://shopifyengineering.myshopify.com/blogs/engineering/five-years-of-react-native-at-shopify)

**[Five years of React Native at Shopify](https://shopifyengineering.myshopify.com/blogs/engineering/five-years-of-react-native-at-shopify)**

Shopify successfully migrated all their 6 apps to React Native, and shared a nuanced feedback summarizes well the tradeoffs of using React Native in practice. On the positive side we have: cross-platform support, performance, hot reloading, knowledge portability... You still need native knowledge, and a few things could be improved, such as the debugging experience and the ability to easily upgrade.
