Hi everyone!

**Kacper and Tymek from [Software Mansion](https://swmansion.com/?utm_source=thisweekinreact)** here 👋.

With a slightly quieter week, we come mostly with great articles we think you might like, alongside a few interesting releases\! We're so excited about the Vite team working on RSC support, a new React Query proposal, in conjunction with the features coming in React Native 0.80, but there are still many new topics here to look at.

Let's dive in\!

Some red flags [PostHog](https://go.posthog.com/twir-may14-ph) has found in teams failing to ship fast: waiting for 1:1s to solve problems, needing other teams to approve your work, and sales outnumbering engineering 🚩

[![TanStackDB](/emails/issues/234/tanstackdb.jpg)](https://github.com/TanStack/db)

**[TanStack DB](https://github.com/TanStack/db)**

A brand-new library from the TanStack team has been introduced in collaboration with ElectricSQL, which brings a lot of exciting features. It gives you a blazing fast query engine, fine-grained reactivity for minimal re-renders, robust transaction primitives and normalized data by default\!

It is built on TanStack Store and is working with and alongside TanStack Query, which extends its capabilities with collections, live queries and optimistic mutations.

Chiara Mooney from Microsoft described how they use React Native to implement the newest Copilot features in their flagship MS Office suite used **by 600 million people**.

They are using it with the island architecture, a pattern embraced in the frontend ecosystem by frameworks such as Astro.
