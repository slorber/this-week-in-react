**[TanStack DB](https://github.com/TanStack/db)**

A brand-new library from the TanStack team has been introduced in collaboration with ElectricSQL, which brings a lot of exciting features. It gives you a blazing fast query engine, fine-grained reactivity for minimal re-renders, robust transaction primitives and normalized data by default\!

It is built on TanStack Store and is working with and alongside TanStack Query, which extends its capabilities with collections, live queries and optimistic mutations.
