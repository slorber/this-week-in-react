- 📜 [React Compiler, How Does It Work?](https://yongseok.me/blog/en/react_compiler_1/): A 4-part series going really deep on the React Compiler code, explaining the Babel Plugin, useMemoCache, HIR/SSA transformations. That’s a lot of implementation details to read, and very technical, but there are also great overviews that describe the main algorithms at the end of each post. It operates on individual functions, with an AST “lowered” to a Hight-level Intermediate Representation (HIR) that also permits to decouple the compiler from Babel. A quite advanced piece of technology!
- 📜 [Avoiding premature abstraction with Unstyled React Components](https://buildui.com/posts/avoiding-premature-abstraction-with-unstyled-react-components): Sam refactors a concrete Form button to a headless LoadingButton abstraction that remains flexible and doesn’t prematurely abstract styling. I agree, and once time comes you can still create another styled abstraction on top.
- 📜 [Common Sense Refactoring of a Messy React Component](https://alexkondov.com/refactoring-a-messy-react-component/): Alex explains his process to refactor a bloated real-world Form component. I do the same: extracting sub-components, custom hooks, and helper code from the main component usually improves clarity.
- 📜 [Introducing XState Store](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/introducing-x-state-store): Dominik (React Query) likes Zustand, but explains why he now finds XState Store a more compelling option. It’s quite similar but more opinionated (separate state/actions, event-driven…). Daishi answered you can get a similar interface with his new [Zustand-xs middleware](https://github.com/zustandjs/zustand-xs). I explained ([tweet](https://x.com/sebastienlorber/status/1821166302469194062)) why I’m not always a fan of an event-driven interface.
- 📜 [Using Notion as my CMS with Next.js](https://jordaneldredge.com/notes/notion-cms/): Describes a setup to reduce the friction of creating and publishing notes. Notion content is first converted as Markdown, and then renderer in a Next.js app.
