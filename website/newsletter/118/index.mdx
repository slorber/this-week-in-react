Hi everyone!

Good news: the new React beta docs will be available soon! A link on the old doc invites to visit the new beta site. Gatsby v5 released alpha.

The current trend: bringing reactivity to React.

Some nice React-Native content too. We are watching closely the progress of Expo Router, WishList and web support in Reassure.

TypeScript celebrates its 10th anniversary. A `--watch` mode is coming in Node.js. Interesting content about WebAssembly.

## ⚛️ React {#react}

**[Gatsby v5 Alpha](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/gatsby-v5-alpha-is-here-and-its-pretty-exciting/)**

The v5 of Gatsby is in alpha with 2 main new features:

- support for [partial hydration](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/a-look-at-partial-hydration-in-gatsby-5/) based on React Server Components and a `"client export"` directive at the top of client components
- the Gatsby Slices API, which allows to significantly improve build times when a shared component (layout/navbar/footer) should be re-rendered

**[Making React fast by default and truly reactive](https://legendapp.com/open-source/legend-state/)**

Interactive article that illustrates the problems of re-rendering in React which is not optimized by default. Shows how the Legend-State library, based on observables, allows to bring reactivity to React (a bit like SolidJS). The code is then optimized by default and avoids unnecessary re-renders.

**[Ezno - Experimental compiler](https://kaleidawave.github.io/posts/introducing-ezno/)**

A new experimental type-checking compiler for JavaScript, compatible with TypeScript annotations and JSX. Relies on dependent typing to do advanced static analysis and pre-evaluations at compile-time (reminds [prepack](https://prepack.io/)). The goal seems to be to be able to compile an app that looks like React in a reactive form, and skip the VDOM. Quite technical to read.

**[(Lazy) Components Maps](https://julesblom.com/writing/lazy-component-maps)**

Presents a useful technique to know to leverage code-splitting when you do conditional rendering. Especially useful on large enums/union-types, such as an `<Icon name="my-icon-name"/>` component.

**[Whyframe](https://whyframe.dev/)**

Allows frontend component rendering to be isolated in an iframe. Now supports [Webpack, Next.js and Docusaurus](https://twitter.com/bluwyoo/status/1576947013450539008). This seems handy for component library documentation sites, ensuring the global CSS of the site does not affect the rendering of the component displayed.

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

**[Reassure - Continuous App Performance Monitoring Made Simple](https://www.callstack.com/blog/app-performance-monitoring)**

Callstack estimates 80% of performance problems on React-Native come from JS, and in particular from React misuse. They created Reassure, a new performance regression testing library. It integrates well with your CI to prevent the performance of your apps from degrading over time. The [web support](https://github.com/callstack/reassure/issues/39) is not yet available.
