Hi everyone!

This is a crazy week, we have a lot of major releases coming from everywhere, in all the sections of this newsletter, that it's impossible to cover them all as they deserve.

I'm particularly excited about the React Native ecosystem improving CSS compatibility with v0.77 and Reanimated v4. This is awesome news for cross-platform development compatibility.

The frontend ecosystem is on fire too 🔥 with awesome releases such as Bun 1.2, Rspack 1.2, Vitest 3.0.

And, Tailwind v4 is expected to drop anytime soon too ! (just after I hit send of course 😅)

## ⚛️ React {#react}

[![React Scan 0.1](/emails/issues/218/react-scan.jpg)](https://github.com/aidenybai/react-scan)

[**React Scan 0.1**](https://github.com/aidenybai/react-scan)

This is the first official release of React Scan, a new React performance tool that has been trending on social platforms lately with many great demos from its creator Aiden Bai. It’s easy to install and helps you find unwanted React re-renders with a great DX, a bit like “why-did-you-update” on steroids.

[![Tests are dead - Meticulous is here](/emails/issues/217/meticulous.jpg)](https://www.meticulous.ai?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_campaign=jan22nd)

**[Tests are dead - Meticulous is here](https://www.meticulous.ai?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_campaign=jan22nd)**

Meticulous creates and maintains an exhaustive suite of e2e ui tests with **zero** developer effort.

This quote from the CTO of Traba sums the product up best: "Meticulous has fundamentally changed the way we approach frontend testing in our web applications, fully eliminating the need to write any frontend tests. The software gives us confidence that every change will be completely regression tested, allowing us to ship more quickly with significantly fewer bugs in our code. The platform is easy to use and reduces the barrier to entry for backend-focused devs to contribute to our frontend codebase."

Meticulous is used by companies like Lattice, Bilt Rewards, Power and many others.

This [post](https://www.meticulous.ai/blog/lessons-from-a-decade?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_campaign=jan15th) from our CTO sets out the context of why exhaustive testing can double engineering velocity.

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

[![React Native 0.77](/emails/issues/218/react-native-0.77.jpg)](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2025/01/21/version-0.77)

[**React Native 0.77**](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2025/01/21/version-0.77)

As planned, the next React Native version just dropped. It notably ships with:

- CSS support improvement: `display: contents`, `boxSizing`, `mixBlendMode`, and `outline`
- Support for Android 15 edge-to-edge and 16KB memory page size (perf improvement)
- iOS init template with Swift AppDelegate

Good news for Expo users: [SDK 52 already supports v0.77](https://expo.dev/changelog/2025/01-21-react-native-0.77), alongside many infrastructure packages (Screens, RNGH, Reanimated). For React 19 support, we’ll have to wait v0.78, but I could come sooner than you expect!

[![Reanimated 4.0 beta](/emails/issues/218/reanimated4.jpg)](https://blog.swmansion.com/reanimated-4-is-new-but-also-very-familiar-b926dd59aa40)

[**Reanimated 4.0 beta**](https://blog.swmansion.com/reanimated-4-is-new-but-also-very-familiar-b926dd59aa40)

Reanimated 4 is in beta, and it’s a huge one\! 🔥 The animation core has been revamped. You can now just animate things, with regular CSS, on the native thread, thanks to newly added support for:

- CSS property transitions
- CSS keyframe animations

This is particularly exciting for React Native micro-interactions with greatly reduced boilerplate, and the ability to ship cross-platform animations. The existing worklet APIs remains retrocompatible and relevant for more advanced needs. However, the New Architecture is now a requirement.

See also [Reactiive migrates a Reanimated v2 animation to v4](https://reactiive.io/articles/css-animations-react-native) which greatly simplifies things. And we are not even talking about migrating old Reanimated v1 code 🙈.

Side note: have you seen the [upcoming React `<ViewTransition>` component](https://motion.dev/blog/reacts-experimental-view-transition-api) being actively worked on? It’s not in React-DOM, and there’s probably an exciting reason for that 👀.
