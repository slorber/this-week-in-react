## ⚛️ React {#react}

[![Parcel v2.14.0](/emails/issues/226/parcel.jpg)](https://parceljs.org/blog/v2-14-0/)

[**Parcel v2.14.0**](https://parceljs.org/blog/v2-14-0/)

Parcel is an interesting thing: it’s a very robust and feature-complete bundler, but it’s not used/supported by any major React framework. It doesn’t prevent it from moving forward, with v2.14.0 adding a few big features:

- Server Components with client, server, and static rendering
- Integrated MDX support (using the rust lib `mdx-rs`)
- A `create-parcel` CLI that can be a replacement for `create-react-app`
- A new React error overlay

If you’re “building your own framework” or have a niche use case, all this makes parcel even more attractive.

[![Tests are dead - Meticulous is here](/emails/issues/217/meticulous.jpg)](https://www.meticulous.ai?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_campaign=mar19th)

**[Tests are dead - Meticulous is here](https://www.meticulous.ai?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_campaign=mar19th)**

Meticulous creates and maintains an exhaustive suite of e2e ui tests with **zero** developer effort.

Dropbox, Bilt Rewards, Lattice and hundreds of engineering organizations rely on Meticulous for their frontend testing.

This quote from the CTO of Traba sums the product up best: "Meticulous has fundamentally changed the way we approach frontend testing in our web applications, fully eliminating the need to write any frontend tests. The software gives us confidence that every change will be completely regression tested, allowing us to ship more quickly with significantly fewer bugs in our code."

This [post](https://www.meticulous.ai/blog/lessons-from-a-decade?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_campaign=jan15th) from our CTO, who formerly led a large engineering group at Palantir, sets out the context of why exhaustive testing can double engineering velocity.

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

[![React Native Worklets RFC](/emails/issues/226/worklets.jpg)](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated/discussions/7264)

[**React Native Worklets RFC**](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated/discussions/7264)

React Native Worklets is a new library extracted from Reanimated that enables true multithreading in React Native. It lets you run JavaScript code on multiple runtimes. A new memory model introduces `Serializables`, `Shareables`, and `Synchronizables` to handle data across runtimes.

By decoupling multithreading from animations, Reanimated becomes leaner, which is especially beneficial for web apps aiming for smaller bundle sizes. At the same time, developers can now use multithreading for non-UI tasks like async storage, database operations, real-time audio processing, or AI-powered computations — without depending on an animation library.
