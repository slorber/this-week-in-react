Hi everyone!

This week, we're celebrating [10 years of React](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/status/1662957673573130244)! 🥳️

There have been quite a few interesting articles these last 2 weeks, particularly related to the complexity of introduced with Server Components. Dan Abramov has published some interesting resources on the subject. Remix and Redwood have announced their intention to support RSCs.

On the React-Native side, 3 conferences have been held recently and playlists are becoming available on YouTube. I [had a great time at the React-Native-Connection](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/status/1664584407775051779), a new React-Native conference in Paris. Thanks to everyone who came and made this first edition a success.

So cool, the newsletter [won a React Open Source Award](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/status/1664667086860308481) at the React Summit conference! Thanks to everyone who voted for me, I wasn't expecting to win given the other nominees 😆

[![Why do Client Components get SSR'd to HTML?](/emails/issues/147/client-component.jpg)](https://github.com/reactwg/server-components/discussions/4)

**[Why do Client Components get SSR'd to HTML?](https://github.com/reactwg/server-components/discussions/4)**

Dan Abramov's short visual explanation of the difference between the Client Tree (what we already knew) and the Server Tree (new). I found this diagram interesting, because it demystifies an easy confusion: Client Components are in fact what we used to call simple React components. During SSR, **Client Components are executed on the server**, exactly as before.

[![How the Raycast API and extensions work](/emails/issues/147/raycast.jpg)](https://www.raycast.com/blog/how-raycast-api-extensions-work)

**[How the Raycast API and extensions work](https://www.raycast.com/blog/how-raycast-api-extensions-work)**

Raycast is an extensible launcher for MacOS, an app renowned for its quality. This article explains the steps they went through to implement their plugin system. They didn't want to compromise on UX and DX: no WebView nor Electron, good security, and the possibility of using npm packages. They finally opted to create a custom React renderer that runs in a separate Node process, and drives native views with Swift through a JSON bridge. It looks a lot like React-Native.

- 📜 [Is React Having An Angular.js Moment?](https://marmelab.com/blog/2023/06/05/react-angularjs-moment.html): does the arrival of Server Components represent a paradigm shift similar to Angular.js vs Angular 2? No, because Server Components are an optional new feature and the rest of React continues to work as before. This article does warn, however, that it may be a little early to recommend and adopt RSCs, and the ecosystem isn't fully ready.
- 📜 [Opinionated notes on React Server components](https://github.com/nilshartmann/react-server-component-material/blob/notes-on-rsc/notes-on-rsc.md): set of notes and reflections on RSCs. Comprehensive and well-documented resource, with many relevant external references.
- 📜 [Isomorphic Development](https://meijer.ws/articles/isomorphic-development): interesting thoughts on the complexity Server Components bring. It's not the Server Components themselves that are complex, but the new hybrid nature of our codebase, and its less well-defined boundaries.
- 📜 [The evolution of React APIs and code reuse](https://frontendmastery.com/posts/the-evolution-of-react-patterns/): reviews the different patterns used over time, and their trade-offs (mixins, HOCs, render props, hooks, RSCs).
- 📜 [Why We Are Dropping Support For Next Js](https://www.stormkit.io/blog/why-we-are-dropping-support-for-next-js): the Stormkit deployment platform is abandoning support for Next.js, which was too complex for their small team to handle. Instead, they propose to use a React + Vite template that supports SSR.
- 📜 [A better learning path for React with server components](https://scastiel.dev/better-learning-path-react): what if RSCs actually made React easier to learn? I think it makes sense if you adopt a fresh perspective.
- 📜 [RedwoodJS’ Next Epoch: All In on React Server Components](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2023/05/30/redwoods-next-epoch-all-in-on-rsc.html): Tom Preston-Werner (creator of GitHub) announcing that the Redwood framework plans to implement React Server Components. Until now, Redwood generated an SPA without SSR (limited for SEO), and the forced use of GraphQL was not always the best choice.
- 📜 [Solving hydration errors in Remix](https://www.jacobparis.com/content/remix-hydration-errors): good advice on debugging React hydration errors. This can also be applied to other frameworks.
- 📜 [What is JSX.IntrinsicElements?](https://www.totaltypescript.com/what-is-jsx-intrinsicelements): TypeScript uses IntrinsicElements to find out which JSX elements are natively supported. It is possible to declare your own native elements, which is what frameworks like React do.
