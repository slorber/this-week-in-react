**[Next.js auth tutorial with RSCs and Server Actions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoRG1q_kVo8)**

The latest tutorial with WorkOS and Sam Selikoff shows how you can easily add AuthKit's hosted login box to a Next.js app:  
  
📚 Get started using the Authkit <> Next.js [integration library](https://github.com/workos/authkit-nextjs)  
🤖 Set up environment variables, configure the callback route and middleware, and implement signIn and signOut functionalities  
⚙️ Protect routes in the Next.js app from unauthenticated users with the getUser function

AuthKit can be used with WorkOS User Management, which supports MFA, identity linking, email verification, user impersonation, and more.

Best of all, it's **free up to 1,000,000 MAUs 🚀**
