[![React Router 7.0](/emails/issues/211/reactrouter.jpg)](https://remix.run/blog/react-router-v7)

**[React Router 7.0](https://remix.run/blog/react-router-v7)**

As planned, Remix features have been brought to React Router, and the full-stack framework features are now powered by a Vite plugin. There are also new features related to routing, type safety, and route pre-rendering. Remix v2 users are invited to upgrade to React Router v7: it should be easy after turning on the future flags. Now that this great milestone has been completed and the team can fully focus on the next wave of innovation, we can't wait to hear the next Michael Jackson Remix.
