Hi everyone! **Krzysztof and Tomasz from [Software Mansion](https://swmansion.com/?utm_source=thisweekinreact)** here 👋

It's been a fairly calm week for the React ecosystem, but not for the React Native world. Meta has made an exciting announcement about the release of React Native 0.80, where they've decided to officially freeze the Old Architecture. Make sure you're ready to adapt your app to the New Architecture, as it seems like it could be the last moment to do so.

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

[![React Native 0.80 overview](/emails/issues/239/RN_banner.png)](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2025/06/12/react-native-0.80)

[**React Native 0.80**](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2025/06/12/react-native-0.80)

This milestone release announces the goal of [Moving Towards a Stable JavaScript API](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2025/06/12/moving-towards-a-stable-javascript-api), an ongoing effort to accurately define the JS and TypeScript APIs.

Here are the highlights:

- React 19.1: Its new `captureOwnerStack()` API can improve the DX of error overlays.
- JavaScript deep imports deprecation: You’ll have to import everything from the root `’react-native’` exports.
- Strict TypeScript API (opt in): The Strict TypeScript API is an opt-in preview offering more accurate TypeScript types for the react-native package, generated directly from source code.
- Legacy Architecture Freezing & Warnings: The React Native team will now focus on the New Architecture.
- iOS Prebuilds for React Native: iOS builds are roughly 12% faster thanks to shipping prebuilds for Folly and GLog rather than building them from source. In a future release, the rest of React Native core will be shipped as a prebuild.
