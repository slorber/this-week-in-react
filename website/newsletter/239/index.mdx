Hi everyone! **Krzysztof and Tomasz from [Software Mansion](https://swmansion.com/?utm_source=thisweekinreact)** here 👋

It's been a fairly calm week for the React ecosystem, but not for the React Native world. Meta has made an exciting announcement about the release of React Native 0.80, where they've decided to officially freeze the Old Architecture. Make sure you're ready to adapt your app to the New Architecture, as it seems like it could be the last moment to do so.

🗓️ [React Summit US](https://reactsummit.us/?utm_source=Newsletter&utm_medium=ThisWeekinReact) - 🇺🇸 New York - 18 & 21 Nov. Final early bird opportunity! Join Addy Osmani (Google Chrome), Shaundai Person (Netflix), Shawn Swyx Wang & more!

You don't need to take care of cache invalidation because the server is still the source of truth.
