Hi everyone!

We're covering 2 weeks of news, including 2 great releases: Astro 3.0 and VisionCamera 3.0. There have also been a lot of interesting articles, so I've had to filter a bit!

Bun 1.0 coming out tonight. I'm curious to see what they have planned. Having tested it on unit tests as a replacement for Jest, it's really very fast.

The React-Native EU conference kicks off today. I spotted some [🐦 very interesting talks](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/status/1696837186677530813), particularly the one on Static Hermes.

For those who want to visit Italy, go to [reactjsday](https://2023.reactjsday.it/) in Verona on 27 October 27. The conference is offering [-10% on tickets](https://ti.to/grusp/reactjsday-2023/discount/media_TWIR) and 2 online/remote tickets to our readers, which I'm giving away to the first 2 people who reply to this email and claim them.

I often forget to mention it here, but I "build in public". You can check out my latest [monthly Indie Hackers report](https://www.indiehackers.com/product/french-react-newsletter) and [🐦 more Twitter details](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/status/1699065823959421109).

[![Astro 3.0](/emails/issues/158/astro3.jpg)](https://astro.build/blog/astro-3/)

[**Astro 3.0**](https://astro.build/blog/astro-3/)

This new version of Astro innovates in particular through the use of the new View Transition API, and the ability to navigate fluidly and animatedly from one page to another, while preserving the state of the components displayed. This reduces the need for a SPA in many use cases.

Other notable improvements include:

- Image Optimization stable
- Faster Rendering Performance: Astro components render 30-75% faster.
- SSR Enhancements for Serverless: New ways to connect to your hosting platform.
- HMR Enhancements for JSX: Fast Refresh support for React and Preact.
- Optimized Build Output: Cleaner and more performant HTML.

[**Making Sense of React Server Components**](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/server-components/)

Josh Comeau is back with a great introduction to React Server Components, taken from his [course](https://www.joyofreact.com/) that should become available next week. The many animated diagrams make it easy to understand this new React paradigm.

[![A Non-Cloud Alternative to Google Forms that has it all](/emails/issues/155/surveyjs.jpg)](https://surveyjs.io/?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=email)

**[A Non-Cloud Alternative to Google Forms that has it all](https://surveyjs.io/?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=email)**

If you are looking to set up a robust form management system fully integrated in your IT infrastructure that allows you to retain full control over the data flow, and you don’t want to spend months and thousands of dollars to get it up and running, then SurveyJS is the way to go!

SurveyJS is a product suite of four open-source JavaScript libraries that allow you to create and edit multiple dynamic JSON-based forms in a drag-and-drop form builder, render them in your React app and store sensitive survey data within your in-house infrastructure. You can then render your custom surveys and forms as editable PDF files in a browser and visualize survey results with interactive charts and tables.

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

[![VisionCamera 3.0](/emails/issues/158/visioncamera3.jpg)](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-vision-camera/releases/tag/v3.0.0)

[**VisionCamera 3.0**](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-vision-camera/releases/tag/v3.0.0)

The new version of VisionCamera has just been released. Highlights:

- Full Android Camera2 rewrite
- Custom GPU OpenGL Video Pipeline
- New Camera Features
- New Frame Processor Engine (react-native-worklets-core)
- New Frame Processor Plugin API

Marc took the decision to finally [remove the integration with Skia](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-vision-camera/pull/1740) to keep the code size and complexity reasonable on VisionCamera.

In [**Pose Detection using VisionCamera V3, TFLite and Skia**](https://mrousavy.com/blog/VisionCamera-Pose-Detection-TFLite), he explains what is possible with such integration. The results are very impressive.
