**[The Category-Defining React Grid for Your Enterprise ](https://1771technologies.com/graphitegrid)**

Data grids are complex components of web applications, but current solutions are inefficient, require a lot of maintenance, and perform poorly. [Graphite Grid](https://1771technologies.com/graphitegrid) transforms the landscape with two key features: retargetable rendering and reactive signal state.

**Graphite Grid** separates grid state from view logic, allowing a single unified state model to support a variety of render targets, declaratively or imperatively. It includes a **DOM and Canvas** renderer, giving developers flexible, high-performance options 🚀.

Graphite Grid is declarative and consistent, leveraging state signals to ensure seamless integration with your application. Designed with **React in mind**, it is the only JavaScript data grid built with React's state management primitives. [Try it now!](https://1771technologies.com/graphitegrid/demo)

**[React 19 and Suspense - A Drama in 3 Acts](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/react-19-and-suspense-a-drama-in-3-acts)**

React 19 RC.0 was released 2 weeks ago and could have become the React 19 stable release we've been waiting for. Unfortunately, it contains a controversial change to the Suspense behavior, leading the React team to talk and decide to delay the release until a solution is found.

Unlike React 18, in v19 the siblings of a component that suspend won’t render anymore, leading to potential waterfalls. In many situations (using “fetch-on-render” pattern, using React.lazy()...), async code might run sequentially instead of in parallel. There’s a good reason motivating this change: the ability to display Suspense fallbacks sooner, and avoid rendering components uselessly. In theory, waterfalls could be avoided if requests were “hoisted” at the router level (using the “render-as-you-fetch” pattern), but many existing apps do not do that and would suffer from degraded performances.

A new interactive playground to see how React works under the hood. It’s possible to explore internals step-by-step. You can even select the React version, and it’s particularly relevant for today’s issue because it can show the Suspense behavior difference between React 18 and React 19!

Surprisingly preloading data can even give you a lower INP score. Using a React example from the Next.js docs site (js/ts code block language picker), he explains that user input must be acknowledged within 200ms. He suggests using either his package “await-interaction-response” or React transitions to separate user input handling from rendering the meaningful result.
