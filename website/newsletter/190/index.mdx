Hi everyone!

I (Seb) am back, and happy to share that the newsletter crossed **40 000 subscribers**! 🎉

Thanks for your support and for sharing the newsletter with your friends.\
Any idea to make it even better, share feedback, or submit a link? Just reply to this email!

This week the React 19 stable release that we expected very soon is delayed a bit due to a controversial change in how Suspense behaves.

On the React Native side, the first RC of 0.75 is expected very soon, running under React 19.

**[The Category-Defining React Grid for Your Enterprise ](https://1771technologies.com/graphitegrid)**

Data grids are complex components of web applications, but current solutions are inefficient, require a lot of maintenance, and perform poorly. [Graphite Grid](https://1771technologies.com/graphitegrid) transforms the landscape with two key features: retargetable rendering and reactive signal state.

**Graphite Grid** separates grid state from view logic, allowing a single unified state model to support a variety of render targets, declaratively or imperatively. It includes a **DOM and Canvas** renderer, giving developers flexible, high-performance options 🚀.

Graphite Grid is declarative and consistent, leveraging state signals to ensure seamless integration with your application. Designed with **React in mind**, it is the only JavaScript data grid built with React's state management primitives. [Try it now!](https://1771technologies.com/graphitegrid/demo)

![Suspense with siblings](/emails/issues/190/suspense.jpg)

**[React 19 and Suspense - A Drama in 3 Acts](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/react-19-and-suspense-a-drama-in-3-acts)**

React 19 RC.0 was released 2 weeks ago and could have become the React 19 stable release we've been waiting for. Unfortunately, it contains a controversial change to the Suspense behavior, leading the React team to talk and decide to delay the release until a solution is found.

Unlike React 18, in v19 if a component suspends, its siblings won't render anymore, leading to potential waterfalls. In many situations (using “fetch-on-render” pattern, using React.lazy()...), async code might run sequentially instead of in parallel. There’s a good reason motivating this change: the ability to display Suspense fallbacks sooner, and avoid rendering components uselessly. In theory, waterfalls could be avoided if requests were “hoisted” at the router level (using the “render-as-you-fetch” pattern), but many existing apps do not do that and would suffer from degraded performances.

A new interactive playground to see how React works under the hood. It’s possible to explore internals step-by-step. You can even select the React version, and it’s particularly relevant for today’s issue because it can show the Suspense behavior difference between React 18 and React 19!

Using a React example from the Next.js docs site (js/ts code block language picker), he explains that user input must be acknowledged within 200ms. He suggests using either his package “await-interaction-response” or React transitions to separate user input handling from rendering the meaningful result.

As there is no “big headline news” this week, I want to take the opportunity to celebrate two projects within the React Native community. The team behind React Native [visionOS received the React Open Source Award](https://x.com/michalchudziak/status/1801632496100008121) in the category “Most Exciting Use of Technology,” and the team at Infinite Red released the [300th episode of the React Native Radio](https://reactnativeradio.com/episodes/rnr-300-special-episode-ask-us-anything) podcast this week. Congratulations to both teams and thank you for the work you all do for our community!
