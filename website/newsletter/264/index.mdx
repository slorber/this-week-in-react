Hi everyone\! Kacper and Filip from [Software Mansion](https://swmansion.com/) here\! 👋

It seems like the winter break brought a lot of great articles from the community. While for some, early January is a time for reflection, summaries, and reviews of 2025, others can’t stop shipping.

In the React space, we have a new version of Next.js 16.1, security fixes for React Router, and the announcement of the alpha version of Waku 1.0.

As for React Native, we have the release of Voltra, a new way to create Live Activities & Widgets in React, and a sneak peek of React Native 0.84 with Hermes v1 enabled by default.

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

[![Voltra](/emails/issues/264/voltra.jpg)](https://www.callstack.com/blog/live-activities-and-widgets-with-react-say-hello-to-voltra)

[**Voltra 1.0 \- Live Activities & Widgets with JSX in React Native**](https://www.callstack.com/blog/live-activities-and-widgets-with-react-say-hello-to-voltra)

Voltra is a new library that allows React Native devs compose Live Activities and Widgets using SwiftUI primitives in just JSX, without having to write native code.

While previous community attempts, such as [expo-apple-targets](https://github.com/EvanBacon/expo-apple-targets) or [expo-live-activity](https://github.com/software-mansion-labs/expo-live-activity), either supported a limited set of possible layouts or required knowledge of Swift, Voltra seems to overcome these limitations.

Note that Expo is also working on their own [solution for Widgets & Live Activities](https://x.com/k7grzywacz/status/2000980494998175934) coming in Expo SDK 55\.
