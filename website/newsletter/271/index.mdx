**[Still writing tests manually?](https://www.meticulous.ai?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=26q1&utm_content=1st)**

Notion, Dropbox and LaunchDarkly have found a new testing paradigm - and they can't imagine working without it. Built by [ex-Palantir engineers](https://www.meticulous.ai?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=26q1&utm_content=2nd), Meticulous autonomously creates a continuously evolving suite of E2E UI tests that delivers [near-exhaustive coverage](https://www.meticulous.ai?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=26q1&utm_content=2nd) with *zero developer effort* - impossible to deliver by any other means. 

It works like magic in the background:

*   Near-exhaustive coverage on every test run
*   No test creation
*   **No maintenance (seriously)**
*   Zero flakes (built on a deterministic browser)

**🤨** Curious? [Book in a time to learn more](https://www.meticulous.ai?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=26q1&utm_content=2nd)

[![Add a powerful Form Builder to your app in hours!](/emails/issues/270/optimajet.jpg)](https://formengine.io/react-form-builder-library/?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=sponsor2-040326&utm_campaign=mui-designer&utm_content=dragdrop&utm_term=deploy-across)

**[Add a powerful Form Builder to your app in hours!](https://formengine.io/react-form-builder-library/?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=sponsor2-040326&utm_campaign=mui-designer&utm_content=dragdrop&utm_term=deploy-across)**

**Why developers use it instead of building it?**

*   **Plug & play custom components:** Wrap any React component and drop it into the builder — it just works. No internal APIs to learn, no hacky overrides
*   **Deep customization:** Add custom validations, actions, and logic through a clean API
*   **JSON output you control:** Every form saves as a portable JSON schema — store it, version it, own it
*   **Self-hosted & white-label ready:** Run it on your infrastructure, brand it as your own

**Perfect for:** internal tools, admin panels, no-code platforms, SaaS products with custom form needs, and enterprise workflow automation.

**Commercial license. Serious support. No vendor lock-in on your data.**

Quick Start → **Working form builder embedded in your app in under an hour**
