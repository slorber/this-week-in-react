**[Seer: AI that debugs React errors and writes the fix](https://sentry.io/product/seer/?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=paid-community&utm_campaign=seer-fy27q1-seerlaunch&utm_content=newsletter-product-trysentry)**

Most AI coding tools only see your source code. [**Seer, Sentry's AI debugging agent**](https://blog.sentry.io/seer-debug-with-ai-at-every-stage-of-development/?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=paid-community&utm_campaign=seer-fy27q1-seerlaunch&utm_content=newsletter-blog-launch-learnmore), uses everything Sentry knows about how your React application behaves in production—component trees, state updates, user interactions, and runtime errors—to debug locally, in your PR, and in production.

**How it works:**

- Seer scans & analyzes issues using all Sentry's available context.
- In development, Seer debugs alongside you as you build
- In review, Seer alerts you to bugs that are likely to break production
- In production, Seer can find a bug's root cause, suggest a fix, open a PR automatically, or send the fix to your preferred IDE.

[![Building Bulletproof React Components](/emails/issues/268/bulletproof.jpg)](https://shud.in/thoughts/build-bulletproof-react-components)

**[Building Bulletproof React Components](https://shud.in/thoughts/build-bulletproof-react-components)**

A great read from an experienced Vercel engineer, sharing various lessons to harden your React components. The goal is to make them survive real-world usage (SSR, hydration, multiple instances, concurrency, portals, etc.) rather than just working on the happy path.

[![React Native 0.84](/emails/issues/268/rn.jpg)](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2026/02/11/react-native-0.84)

**[React Native 0.84](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2026/02/11/react-native-0.84)**

A new version of React Native just dropped. The highlights:

- Legacy Architecture Components removed for both iOS and Android

[![Gesture Handler 3.0 beta - Hook-Based API, Deeper Reanimated Integration & More](/emails/issues/268/rngh.jpg)](https://blog.swmansion.com/introducing-gesture-handler-3-0-hook-based-api-deeper-reanimated-integration-more-9185b0c8e305)

No APIs were removed, but a new hooks-based API makes it compatible with the React Compiler. They also improved the integration with Reanimated and Animated.
