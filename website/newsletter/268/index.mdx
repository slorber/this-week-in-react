**[Seer: AI that debugs React errors and writes the fix](https://sentry.io/product/seer/?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=paid-community&utm_campaign=seer-fy27q1-seerlaunch&utm_content=newsletter-product-trysentry)**

Most AI coding tools only see your source code. [**Seer, Sentry's AI debugging agent**](https://blog.sentry.io/seer-debug-with-ai-at-every-stage-of-development/?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=paid-community&utm_campaign=seer-fy27q1-seerlaunch&utm_content=newsletter-blog-launch-learnmore), uses everything Sentry knows about how your React application behaves in production—component trees, state updates, user interactions, and runtime errors—to debug locally, in your PR, and in production.

**How it works:**

*   Seer scans & analyzes issues using all Sentry's available context.
*   In development, Seer debugs alongside you as you build
*   In review, Seer alerts you to bugs that are likely to break production
*   In production, Seer can find a bug's root cause, suggest a fix, open a PR automatically, or send the fix to your preferred IDE.
