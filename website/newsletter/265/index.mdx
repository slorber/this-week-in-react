Hi everyone!

This week, we saw a lot of activity on X about the new AI skills system. Personally, what excited me most is the new Firefox release that unlocks interesting things for React developers.

The React Native ecosystem is also super active, with many interesting releases. And I’m sure Expo 55 beta will drop just after we send our email 😅, so make sure to check their blog because it’s coming soon.

Next.js makes it easy to ship fast, but once your app is in production it can be hard to tell where errors, slow requests, or hydration issues are really coming from.

Join Sentry's hands-on workshop where Sergiy Dybskiy will dives into how these problems show up in real apps and how to connect what users experience with what’s happening under the hood. 🚀

[![Agent Skills](/emails/issues/265/skills.jpg)](https://agentskills.io/)

**[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/)**

A new Anthropic spec is gaining traction in the AI dev community. Skills let agents acquire capabilities on demand via progressive disclosure—lazy-loading only what’s needed to keep context slim. It’s been a hot topic in React this week, with multiple projects shipping open-source skills and tooling:

- [Skills.sh](https://skills.sh/), a platform launched by Vercel to discover popular open source skills
- [React Best Practices](https://vercel.com/blog/introducing-react-best-practices) by Vercel for React and Next.js skills. I also liked the related article from one of the authors ([Performance Is Not a Technical Problem](https://x.com/shuding/status/2013632751568851233)).
- [React Native Best Practices](https://www.callstack.com/blog/announcing-react-native-best-practices-for-ai-agents) by Callstack, including many React Native optimization skills
- [Expo Skills](https://github.com/expo/skills) for Expo apps and EAS projects
- [Remotion Skills](https://x.com/Remotion/status/2013626968386765291) are trending on X, showing that you can vibe code videos with React 🤪

[![Firefox 147](/emails/issues/265/firefox.jpg)](https://www.firefox.com/en-US/firefox/147.0/releasenotes/)

**[Firefox 147](https://www.firefox.com/en-US/firefox/147.0/releasenotes/)**

You might wonder why Firefox is the headline of the React section? It turns out this release is quite important for React developers, unlocking 3 new APIs that are now available in all browsers 🎉:

- [View transition types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API/Using_types) \- React is relying on it (`document.startViewTransition({update, types})`) to conditionally enable its `<ViewTransition>` component. That component is still canary, but once unflagged, it should now work in all recent browsers\!
- [CSS anchor positioning](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/anchor-positioning-api) \- An awesome addition to CSS that should replace the need for JS-based positioning libraries many React apps used for dropdowns and tooltips, such as Tether, Popper.js, Floating UI…
- [Navigation API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/navigation-api/) \- This completely redefines the APIs used to build client-side routers / SPAs, providing a clean, centralized way to intercept navigation events, instead of using the clunky `history` API.
