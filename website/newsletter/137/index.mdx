Hi everyone!

This week, there is still a lot of content about signals, but it's the turn of Server Components to take over the discussions!

One week left to send your talk proposal to the CFP of [React-Native-Connection](https://reactnativeconnection.io/) (Paris - June 1st).

[![WTF Is Code Extraction](/emails/issues/137/codeextraction.jpg)](https://www.builder.io/blog/wtf-is-code-extraction)

**[WTF Is Code Extraction](https://www.builder.io/blog/wtf-is-code-extraction)**

Miško (Qwik) explains the advantages of co-locating server/client code in the same file and the limitations of the current Next.js model (export extraction): you can only declare one `getServerSideProps` function and you have to make use of `ReturnType` to inject the right data type into the client component. Function extraction and closure extraction offer a better developer experience.

These techniques are not yet used in the React world today, but we can expect to see them appear in our frameworks soon. The Qwik team plans to [decouple its code extraction](https://twitter.com/manucorporat/status/1630955309890957313) from the framework. Tanner Linsley is [collaborating with them](https://twitter.com/tannerlinsley/status/1630994907405115393) and [is already using this type of extraction on Bling](https://twitter.com/tannerlinsley/status/1631003945522065409), the toolkit that should power the upcoming TanStack Start framework.

I think we can also include React Server Components in the category of techniques that allow to seamlessly mix server/client code: we should rather consider this solution when discussing the current limits of Next.js.

![React Server Components](/emails/issues/137/rsc.jpg)

**React Server Components**

After signals, it's the turn of Server Components to be in the spotlight this week. Dan Abramov triggered many discussions while looking for good mental models to explain the new feature. You'll have to dig into these discussions to find the analogies that speak to you the most.

Server Components could also have unsuspected benefits: [a communication layer for Electron threads](https://twitter.com/Eli_White/status/1632445703950852096) or [a flexible data-layer for static site generators](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/status/1632310649609920513).

- 📜 [React vs Signals: 10 Years Later](https://dev.to/this-is-learning/react-vs-signals-10-years-later-3k71): Don't miss Dan Abramov's answer on this article by Ryan Carniato. Dan does not want the function of a React component to be "setup" like SolidJS: re-running the function is voluntary.
- 📜 [Making the Case for Signals in JavaScript](https://dev.to/this-is-learning/making-the-case-for-signals-in-javascript-4c7i): Ryan Carniato goes over some good reasons to use signals with some pretty interesting arguments. I also think that you shouldn't have to change the organization of your components for performance reasons.
- 📜 [React’s Upcoming Compiler Only Solves Part Of The Problem](https://www.builder.io/blog/react-compiler-will-not-solve-prop-drilling): explains why the React Forget compiler will not resolve intermediate re-renders, unlike signals.
- 📜 [Were React Hooks a Mistake?](https://jakelazaroff.com/words/were-react-hooks-a-mistake/): Jake explains the problems introduced by hooks, and how signals are quite similar to React class components.

- 📜 [2023 Web Framework Performance Report](https://astro.build/blog/2023-web-framework-performance-report/): Fred (Astro) analyzed real-world perf data to derive trends on how frameworks influence the performance of our apps. We find performance scores for Astro, Gatsby, Remix and Next.js.
- 📜 [Deno - You Don't Need a Build Step](https://deno.com/blog/you-dont-need-a-build-step): explains the complexity behind the 4 build steps of Next.js (compiling, minifying, bundling, code splitting). Proposes an alternative with Fresh and its Just-In-Time mode.

**[Extensible JavaScript libraries for surveys and forms](https://surveyjs.io/?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=referral)**

[SurveyJS](https://surveyjs.io/form-library?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=referral) is a set of open-source JavaScript form libraries that you can easily integrate into your web app. It lets you **create and run multiple forms**, retaining all sensitive data on your servers, or have **your own self-hosted WYSIWYG form builder** that non-tech users can use directly.

You can also **analyze survey results** in custom-built dashboards, save your forms to PDF, or simply **convert them to editable PDF files**. It offers native support for **React and Angular rendering** and total freedom of choice as to the backend, because **any server + database combination is fully compatible**.
