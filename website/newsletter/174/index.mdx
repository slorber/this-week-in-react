Hi everyone!

I took a break last week, so we're catching up on two weeks' worth of news, and there's been a **lot** of it! Many of you like the exhaustive nature of my emails, so... have fun being overwhelmed by the number of links 😅!

We have great updates from Meta, with the React Labs update you are probably already aware of, and more recently the React Strict DOM update for cross-platform enthusiast. I'm also excited for the new milestone Remix 2.7 crossed, marketing th beginning of a migration path from React Router apps to Remix SPA mode.

Last call: want to attend [React Conf 2024](https://conf.react.dev/) (May 15-16 Nevada)? There's only one week left to [win a lottery ticket](https://forms.reform.app/bLaLeE/react-conf-2024-ticket-lottery/1aRQLK), or submit your talk to the [CFP](https://sessionize.com/react-conf-2024/).

## ⚛️ React {#react}

[![React Labs - What We've Been Working On – February 2024](/emails/issues/174/react-labs.jpg)](https://react.dev/blog/2024/02/15/react-labs-what-we-have-been-working-on-february-2024)

**[React Labs - What We've Been Working On – February 2024](https://react.dev/blog/2024/02/15/react-labs-what-we-have-been-working-on-february-2024)**

This week brought us the first official update from React Labs since almost exactly one year ago, and they dropped some exciting announcements. We already covered many of them here, but it’s good to have an official summary!

React Forget is 🐦 [now just called React Compiler](https://twitter.com/en_JS/status/1758224340880158955) and it seems that the production 🐦 [Instagram rollout](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/status/1734607171030303186) has been successful.

The next React release will be a major version. React 19 is around the corner, and there’s a certain [conference](https://conf.react.dev/) that would lend itself to such an announcement 😏. The release will also include built-in support for managing page metadata (built-in support for what React-Helmet did for us, with proper streaming support), Asset Loading (including Suspense integration) and Actions for sending data from client to server. The surface area that meta-frameworks like Next.js and Remix need to cover with proprietary implementations is shrinking.

One of the most underrated upcoming React features, the Offscreen API (named as Activity), is temporarily deprioritized to focus on React 19. We’ll have to wait a bit more to fully leverage the concurrent model introduced by React 18.

Overall, it’s an exciting time to be a React developer, and we look forward to the next major version!

[![Remix 2.7 - Remix Vite is Now Stable](/emails/issues/174/remix-vite.jpg)](https://remix.run/blog/remix-vite-stable)

**[Remix 2.7 - Remix Vite is Now Stable](https://remix.run/blog/remix-vite-stable)**

An important release for Remix, stabilizing the Vite plugin and the SPA mode, proper support for Cloudflare Pages, introducing a preset system, and shipping many other useful improvements. An upcoming dedicated post will likely detail how the new SPA mode will help Vite + React Router apps transition to Remix without having to introduce a server runtime. If you are still using Create-React-App, it might be a good time to consider migrating to Vite!

[![React Strict DOM](/emails/issues/174/strict-dom.jpg)](https://github.com/facebook/react-strict-dom)

**[React Strict DOM](https://github.com/facebook/react-strict-dom)**

Meta not only dropped some big news regarding React this week. Today, a brand-new repo showed up on GitHub: [react-strict-dom](https://github.com/facebook/react-strict-dom). The readme describes it as an “experimental integration of React DOM and StyleX that aims to improve and standardize the development of styled React components for web and native.” It is based on the ideas from the [“React DOM for Native” RFC](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/pull/496) and in my opinion could be huge for how we think about universal app development in the future. Today, the most common approach for universal apps for RN ist React Native Web, which shims RN components and APIs on the web. And while RNW is really great, it often feels like shoehorning one platform into another. The premise of react-strict-dom is that there is a single DOM library which universally supports web, iOS, and Android (and potentially more platforms in the future). The element API is based on web, which is why you see the very HTML-like syntax in the screenshot above.

As always, Dan Abramov is the best in expressing the idea in a concise 🐦 [tweet](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov2/status/1760245165703184516):

> “Looks like a spiritual successor to RNW, but approached from the other direction (web APIs won, so RN is building support for a strict subset). Essentially, you’ll be able to render a `<div>` in RN.”

There’s still a long way to go when you look at the current [compatibility status](https://github.com/facebook/react-strict-dom/blob/main/packages/react-strict-dom/COMPATIBILITY.md), but this is certainly an exciting milestone on a more universal React! Meta is already using it! See also this 🐦 [thread from Lorenzo and the involvement of Microsoft](https://twitter.com/Kelset/status/1760367655423549480).
