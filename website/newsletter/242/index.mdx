Hi everyone! **Kacper and Krzysztof from [Software Mansion](https://swmansion.com/?utm_source=thisweekinreact)** here! üëã

It definitely feels like everyone caught the lazy summer vibe as the whole world went on vacation but we still managed to carve out something interesting for you to read.

We‚Äôve learned how Meta renders React server-side (which is crazy, actually) and Vercel has made some interesting moves in the metaframework sphere by acquiring NuxtLabs.

From the React Native ecosystem, we have React Native Unistyles 3.0, now marked as stable, and we‚Äôve seen the first RC of React Native 0.81, although without any additional context whatsoever.

Enjoy the read!

AI is pretty good at creating bugs. Can it also resolve them?

**Seer** is Sentry‚Äôs new AI agent ‚Äî and the only AI agent that [uses all of the context that Sentry provides](https://sentry.io/product/seer/?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=paid-community&utm_campaign=seer-fy26q2-seerlaunch&utm_content=newsletter-seer-page-learnmore): errors, stack traces, commit history, logs, traces, spans, breadcrumbs.

Seer sifts through the data, finds the root cause of an issue (with 94.5% accuracy!), and can open a PR with a fix. Ship it, close the tab, and move on with your life. It‚Äôs private by default, supports ¬±any stack, and it actually works.

Get hands on with the Sentry engineering team to use Seer, Debug MCP, configure Agent Monitoring on July 23.

[**Unistyles 3.0**](https://www.reactnativecrossroads.com/posts/introducing-unistyles-3)

React Native Unistyles 3.0 is now stable. It‚Äôs a styling library written in C++ that enables recomputing and updating only necessary styles and components based on dependency changes, eliminating unnecessary re-renders. The library is now powered by Nitro Modules and supports only the New Architecture. The 3.0 release features an updated API aligned with the React Native StyleSheet, Compound Variants, Scoped Themes, deep integration with React Native Reanimated, and much more.
