Bad performance is just another kind of bug 🐛 . And Sentry helps you find bugs fast, even the ones that aren’t obvious.

*   Cut chunks of time off of bad API calls
    
*   Reduce extremely costly, frequently pinged, or generally slow db operations 
    
*   Uncover the source of a traffic spike spike in minutes
    

Whether it’s an error or a slowdown, Sentry helps you fix issues fast and keep your app running smoothly. Because if it’s slow, it’s broken. [See for yourself](https://sentry.io/lp/new-apm/?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=paid-community&utm_campaign=perf-fy26q1-evergreen&utm_content=newsletter-primary-slowbug-seehow).
