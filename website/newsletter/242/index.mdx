**[Sentry’s new ai agent hits 94.5% root causing accuracy](https://sentry.io/resources/sentry-build/?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=paid-community&utm_campaign=ai-fy26q2-aiworkshop&utm_content=newsletter-ai-workshop-rsvp)**

AI is pretty good at creating bugs. Can it also resolve them?

**Seer** is Sentry’s new AI agent — and the only AI agent that [uses all of the context that Sentry provides](https://sentry.io/product/seer/?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=paid-community&utm_campaign=seer-fy26q2-seerlaunch&utm_content=newsletter-seer-page-learnmore): errors, stack traces, commit history, logs, traces, spans, breadcrumbs.

Seer sifts through the data, finds the root cause of an issue (with 94.5% accuracy!), and can open a PR with a fix. Ship it, close the tab, and move on with your life. It’s private by default, supports ±any stack, and it actually works.

Get hands on with the Sentry engineering team to use Seer, Debug MCP, configure Agent Monitoring on July 23.
