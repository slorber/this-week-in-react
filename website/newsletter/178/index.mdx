Hi everyone!

This week is different and important for me. I took a little newsletter break, and instead of having no issue (as I did before), this time it's [Benedikt](https://twitter.com/bndkt) writing the whole newsletter. Back to you Benedikt!

This last week has not seen a lot of releases, maybe everyone is already saving up their announcements for the upcoming conference season. Astro published more details about their new database and also released a developer portal, which starts out as a theme marketplace but will cover integrations in the future as well. Remix is now Vite-first and Vercel published a new AI chatbot template. After a lot of news about React Server Components in the React section, this week we see some news about RSC in the React Native section.

[![Remix Vite-first](/emails/issues/178/remix_heart_vite.jpg)](https://twitter.com/markdalgleish/status/1770224011831890036)

🐦 [**Remix is now Vite-first**](https://twitter.com/markdalgleish/status/1770224011831890036)

After a relatively short period of transition where Remix introduced a Vite-integration marked as unstable, this has now been marked stable and immediately became the new default. I personally really enjoyed seeing this quick transition and think Remix plus Vite is a strong combination, and having Vite be the development environment and compiler for Remix allows the Remix team to decrease their surface area and concentrate on core framework capabilities, which is a good thing! A newly created Remix project now only has a Vite config file referencing a Remix plugin, which I think is a beautiful instance of simplification!

- 📜 [Two Types of Composition](https://kyleshevlin.com/two-types-of-composition/): I think sometimes it’s good to revisit the fundamentals of what we’re doing as developers every day. Composition is one of React’s basic principles, and this article looks at the basics of nesting composition and merging composition.

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

[![React Native RSC](/emails/issues/178/rn_rsc.jpg)](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/tree/master/packages/pigment-css-react)

🐦 [**Demo of React Server Components on React Native**](https://twitter.com/SzymonRybczak/status/1769747995862384756)

Conference season is coming up, and the announcements get fewer as people are saving the best for the big stages. One of the topics I’m looking most forward to hearing more about at the upcoming conferences is React Server Components on React Native. Now Szymon Rybczak from Callstack has published an interesting demo of RSC running in RN. I’m really curious to learn more about it, and glad that Szymon has announced that he’ll publish a detailed blog post and the code soon.
