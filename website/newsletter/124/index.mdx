Hi everyone!

After a few intense weeks, the React ecosystem slows down a bit in terms of major announcements.

We still have some very good articles coming out. The TypeScript plugin for Next.js looks awesome!

The GitHub Universe conference has ended. GitHub seems to be using React more and more, on some views, and also via GitHub Blocks based on MDX.

**[FlyCode Makes React Apps Editable without coding, Git based](https://bit.ly/3UPwAoJ)**

[FlyCode](https://bit.ly/3wWSi00) (YC S22) makes React web apps editable in minutes so Product and UX teams can iterate and release products faster, so they don't have to wait on (or consume) developer time.

FlyCode reads your regular React code and finds Texts, Images, Design tokens and Analytics event, then it let's non-coders collaborate and edit them and send back a pull request (they don't need access to GitHub!)

- Saves development time
- No code integration, it just reads your code!
- GitHub based, a bot is scanning the code and creates pull requests
- Use your own stack and components
- Retain codebase ownership

You can get started here: [flycode.com/developers](https://www.flycode.com/developers)

[![Inside Framer's Magic Motion](/emails/issues/124/framer-motion.png)](https://www.nan.fyi/magic-motion)

**[Inside Framer's Magic Motion](https://www.nan.fyi/magic-motion)**

A great interactive article that explains what a layout animation is. It greatly deconstructs the FLIP technique which allows to make this kind of transition perform better via CSS transforms (position, scale). We recreate the layout animation system of Framer Motion step by step.

On the same subject, I recommend to read also [Everything about Framer Motion layout animations](https://blog.maximeheckel.com/posts/framer-motion-layout-animations/).

[![Timeline of a React Component With Hooks](/emails/issues/124/timeline.jpg)](https://julesblom.com/writing/react-hook-component-timeline)

**[Timeline of a React Component With Hooks](https://julesblom.com/writing/react-hook-component-timeline)**

An interactive diagram that demonstrates the lifecycle of a React component, including hooks, refs, and DOM updates/paint (not available on mobile). Also includes a quiz to test your knowledge, and many quotes/references.

[![Next.js 13](/emails/issues/124/nextjs13ts.jpg)](https://twitter.com/delba_oliveira/status/1592209522281439232)

**[Next.js 13 TypeScript Plugin](https://twitter.com/delba_oliveira/status/1592209522281439232)**

Shu Ding is working on a TypeScript language service plugin ([source](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/next/server/next-typescript.ts)) that significantly improves Next.js DX by bringing docs, new errors and autocompletion on top of Next.js and Server Components conventions. This compensates nicely the [inability to type exports from an ES module](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/38511) in TypeScript, a feature much requested by framework authors.

[![Writing Performant CSS with vanilla-extract](/emails/issues/124/vanilla-extract.png)](https://www.lekoarts.de/javascript/writing-performant-css-with-vanilla-extract)

**[Writing Performant CSS with vanilla-extract](https://www.lekoarts.de/javascript/writing-performant-css-with-vanilla-extract)**

An exhaustive article about [vanilla-extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/), the no-runtime CSS-in-JS library based on TypeScript by Mark Dalgleish (creator of CSS Modules). Mention also its atomic CSS overlay [Sprinkles](https://vanilla-extract.style/documentation/packages/sprinkles/). Examples based on React: reproduction of a Tailwind UI component. Many comparisons with Tailwind and other CSS-in-JS solutions. Well, it looks powerful, but not so simple indeed 😅 We'll have to study this further.

- 📜 [A Love Letter to React](https://fly.io/blog/love-letter-react/): the creator of Phoenix (Elixir framework) explains how he was inspired by React to create LiveView: a solution to add interactivity on server-side rendered HTML. LiveView reminds me a lot of Remix!
