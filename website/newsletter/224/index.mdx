**[Convex: The Database Designed for AI Coding](https://convex.link/thisweekai)**

In the age of code generation, you need a backend that you can confidently generate with AI platforms. Convex is by far and away [best in class](https://stack.convex.dev/introducing-fullstack-bench) in this respect.

This is because Convex is just TypeScript, allowing you to write [queries as code](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions/) that are automatically transactional, cached, and realtime.

And that’s just the beginning. With Convex, you can:

- Easily schedule functions and write cron jobs
- Set up file storage
- Write efficient server functions
- And so much more…

## ⚛️ React {#react}

[![Next.js 15.2](/emails/issues/224/next.jpg)](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-15-2)

[**Next.js 15.2**](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-15-2)

Vercel released a new minor version of Next.js, with major DX improvements. Highlights include:

- Redesigned error UI and improved stack traces: A redesigned debugging experience leveraging the brand-new React [`captureOwnerStack()`](https://react.dev/reference/react/captureOwnerStack) API
- Streaming metadata: Async metadata will no longer block page rendering or client-side page transitions
- Turbopack performance improvements: Faster compile times and reduced memory usage
- React View Transitions (experimental): Experimental support for React's new View Transitions API
- Node.js Middleware (experimental): Experimental support for using the Node.js runtime in Middleware

[![TanStack Form 1.0](/emails/issues/224/form.jpg)](https://tanstack.com/blog/announcing-tanstack-form-v1)

[**TanStack Form 1.0**](https://tanstack.com/blog/announcing-tanstack-form-v1)

A new TanStack library, years in the making, has just been released as stable. The announcement post highlights an interesting subset of its features:

- Framework agnostic, headless: Supports 5 frameworks, including React used in the post's examples
- Extreme type safety: I must admit `<form.Field>` is a pretty cool API
- Schema validation: Support for Zod, Valibot, ArkType, Standard Schema
- Async validation, built-in debouncing, AbortSignal
- Isomorphic, multi-platform: share validation logic across client/server

- 📜 [\{transitions} \= f(state)](https://jordaneldredge.com/blog/transitions-f-of-state/): A rather philosophical article explaining that React can be seen as a state machine where the possible state transitions are implicitly defined by its event handlers. The asynchronous/concurrent nature of React makes it possible to introduce invalid state transitions that you should guard against explicitly.

- 📦 [XState Store 3.0](https://stately.ai/blog/2025-02-26-xstate-store-v3): I particularly like the new `store.trigger` API that permits using the store more ergonomically, in particular for cases where event-driven indirection is not useful. This new version makes it an interesting alternative to Zustand, still lightweight but more opinionated, and a path toward adopting real XState state machines.

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

[![Lynx: Unlock Native for More](/emails/issues/224/lynx.jpg)](https://lynxjs.org/blog/lynx-unlock-native-for-more)

[**Lynx: Unlock Native for More**](https://lynxjs.org/blog/lynx-unlock-native-for-more)

ByteDance just announced Lynx, their native cross-platform technology. It’s used extensively in their production apps, including TikTok\! With React bindings, it’s a serious competitor to React Native, and support for other frameworks is expected. The architectural choices are interesting, with a dual-thread model and different runtimes. It has support for some CSS and Web APIs that even React Native still doesn’t have and uses convenient built-in JSX intrinsic elements like `<view>`.

The feature set at launch is impressive, but there are also some surprising things you might dislike, such as using React 17 / Preact, or custom elements on the web. Time will tell whether the technology lives up to its promise and can truly compete with the established player. In any case, competition is healthy.
