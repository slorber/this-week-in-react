Hi everyone!

This week it's particularly exciting to see React Native Skia reaching 1.0. But we also have many other interesting releases to look at: Pigment, Storybook, Tailwind, Rolldown, MDXTS...

There were also some fun ones, such as Mist and Geist. I'm really curious to know what you think of them. Would you use these?

I'm trying to monitor more closely weak signals (PRs, RFCs and tweets), do you find this kind of news valuable?

[**Pigment CSS**](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/tree/master/packages/pigment-css-react)

The MUI team is working on Pigment, their own zero-runtime CSS-in-JS to replace Emotion in Material UI v6. The first versions have been published to npm, including a Next.js `withPigment()` plugin. Olivier explains in a 🐦 [tweet](https://twitter.com/olivtassinari/status/1765719897152127315) the motivations to create a new solution, and how it compares to existing ones (Panda, StyleX, Tailwind). Unlike all others, this one will ease the adoption for existing Emotion and Styled-Components users.

**[Refine - Open source Retool Alternative](https://github.com/refinedev/refine)**

The sweet spot between the low code and traditional development for CRUD-heavy applications.

As an open-source React meta-framework designed for Enterprise applications, [Refine](https://github.com/refinedev/refine) offers a headless solution ideal for tasks like admin panels, dashboards, and internal tools.

While low-code tools may offer initial promise, they often fall short in handling complex scenarios due to scalability issues, limited customization options, and the risk of vendor lock-in.

Refine enables teams to rapidly develop production-ready apps while maintaining flexibility.

🎥 [**William Candillon - Time to Fly - React Native Skia 1.0**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUbj_NxcgKg)

Exciting major release of React Native Skia, with an inspiring launch video! This library was first released back in 2021 by William Candillon and Christian Falch and has been heavily supported by Shopify for a long time. Now, they’ve finally released a 1.0 and it’s packed with improvements and new features: Thanks to a new Paragraph API, Skia can now render rich text layouts, combining system fonts and custom fonts. Animations Hooks make it easier to build performant animations with the already existing RN Reanimated and Gesture Handler integration. Another highlight for me personally: RN Skia now also supports the web as a platform, via a package called canvaskit-js!
