Hi everyone!

This week we have:

- **React**: A good mix of content and many community articles, but no major announcements.
- **React Native**: The 2024 survey results are out, infra libraries now support RN 0.78, and Nitro Views have been released!
- **Other**: Several TC39 proposals are progressing—my favorites are `import defer` and `RegExp.escape()`.

I'm trying something new, let me know if you like the intro to be split by section like above.

Check our partner [StrapiConf](https://conf.strapi.io/?utm_source=thisweekinreact) - 🇫🇷 Paris - 13 May. Strapi is a popular headless CMS in the React ecosystem, and like me, it's French 🥐! Get a 10% discount with code "TWIR".

[![React-admin: The Open-Source Framework for B2B apps](/emails/issues/223/marmelab.jpg)](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/?ref=TWIR)

**[React-admin: The Open-Source Framework for B2B apps](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/?ref=TWIR)**

[React-admin](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/?ref=TWIR) is the go-to framework for building B2B apps—because let’s be real, nobody dreams of writing yet another CRUD screen. Here’s why thousands of developers swear by it:

- 🔌 **Backend Agnostic:** Connects to any API—because commitment issues aren't just for relationships.
- 🧩 **200+ Building Blocks:** More pre-built components than your project has TODOs.
- 🛠 **Complete Customization:** If you don’t like it, change it. We won’t take it personally (\*wipes away tears\*).
- 💻 **Great Developer Experience:** Makes you feel like a coding rockstar, minus the groupies (unless you count rubber ducks).

With 7 years in production and 1 million daily users, react-admin is a sure bet. So why don’t you [try it out](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin?ref=TWIR) yourself?

**[Tests are dead - Meticulous is here](https://www.meticulous.ai?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_campaign=feb26th)**

Meticulous creates and maintains an exhaustive suite of e2e ui tests with **zero** developer effort. 

Dropbox, Bilt Rewards, Lattice and hundreds of engineering organizations rely on Meticulous for their frontend testing.

This quote from the CTO of Traba sums the product up best: "Meticulous has fundamentally changed the way we approach frontend testing in our web applications, fully eliminating the need to write any frontend tests. The software gives us confidence that every change will be completely regression tested, allowing us to ship more quickly with significantly fewer bugs in our code."

This [post](https://www.meticulous.ai/blog/lessons-from-a-decade?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_campaign=jan15th) from our CTO, who formerly led a large engineering group at Palantir, sets out the context of why exhaustive testing can double engineering velocity.

[![State of React Native 2024 - Survey Results](/emails/issues/223/state-of-rn.jpg)](https://results.stateofreactnative.com/)

**[State of React Native 2024 \- Survey Results](https://results.stateofreactnative.com/)**

The survey results are out and I’m super proud that among all the React Native resources, this newsletter got the highest positivity score. Thank you ❤️!

I can’t summarize the whole survey, but here are a few things I discovered:

- 61% of RN devs came from React (web)
- iOS and Android remain the most common RN targets, but the Web also has a 22% market share
- Libraries with the most positive sentiment are: Reanimated, TanStack Query, Zustand, React Navigation, Expo Router, Skia.
- No clear winner in terms of styling. Devs like the built-in APIs such as StyleSheet and inline styles.
