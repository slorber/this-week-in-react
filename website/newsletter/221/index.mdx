Hi everyone!

Cyril and Matthieu from [Theodo Apps](https://apps.theodo.com/en?utm_source=thisweekinreact) here 👋, standing in for Seb to bring you the latest news from React and React Native!

This week we’ve been carefully reading the [State of React 2024](https://2024.stateofreact.com) survey results, and also found quite a few interesting articles. Things have been quieter when it comes to new releases.

Check our partner conf [App.js](https://appjs.co?utm_source=thisweekinreact), happening May 28-30 in 🇵🇱 Kraków! The biggest React Native and Expo-focused conference gives us a 15% discount with code "TWIR".

[![State of React 2024 - Survey Results](/emails/issues/221/state-of-react.png)](https://2024.stateofreact.com)

**[State of React 2024 - Survey Results](https://2024.stateofreact.com)**

The results of State of React 2024 are out. It is a gold mine of information and we can’t possibly talk about everything here but here are a few highlights:

- Of the “new” React features, Server Components are the most popular with 40% of the ~7000 respondents having “used it”, probably thanks to Next.js…
- `forwardRef` is the most disliked React API, and is going away!
- Have you heard about React’s Taint API? It looks like 80% of React devs have not, which is understandable since it’s experimental.
- There’s not that much movement in the \#1 spot: Next.js, TanStack Query, Axios, Jest, and Zod are still the most frequently used.
- A few rising stars: Zustand and Vitest got more users, TanStack Start is \#1 in interest even though almost no one has used it yet.

Seb wrote the [survey conclusion](https://2024.stateofreact.com/en-US/conclusion/) — be sure to check it out! 🙂

**[Optimizing Vercel Costs: Real-World Strategies](https://pagepro.co/nextjs-hosting-cost-optimization?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=this-week-in-react-expert-session&utm_id=this-week-in-react)**

Deploying Next.js apps on Vercel is easy, but optimizing hosting costs? That’s a different story.

Join Chris Lojniewski and Jakub Dakowicz of Pagepro on **February 20th, 11 AM EST** for a deep analysis of Vercel cost optimization strategies. Learn how to identify what drives your costs and reduce them with **code-level optimizations** like adjusting prefetching to avoid excessive function calls, choosing proper rendering methods, and trimming unnecessary data transfers.

They’ll also show you how to **minimize reliance on Vercel’s premium features** with feature externalization - offloading analytics, image optimization, and password protection. Plus, they’ll break down when enterprise pricing is worth considering and when you’re better off with alternatives. **Stop overpaying, and [register today](https://pagepro.co/nextjs-hosting-cost-optimization?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=this-week-in-react-expert-session&utm_id=this-week-in-react)**.

[![Bolt x Expo](/emails/issues/221/bolt-expo.jpg)](https://expo.dev/blog/bolt-expo-integration-announcement)

**Building apps with AI**

We don't talk too much about LLMs in this newsletter (we guess you already hear about it more than enough 😅) but with all the announcements this week we thought it was a good time to give you an update.

The big news: **[Bolt and Expo have partnered](https://expo.dev/blog/bolt-expo-integration-announcement)** to add (React-)Native mobile apps support to Bolt. Right now you can preview your AI-generated apps on the web, but you need to download the code to go further. They plan to add an integration with EAS to deploy to production in the future.

Some competitors also had things to announce:

- There's now an official Expo template in Replit, and [a demo video you can watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTm_dCF53qk). Replit has an app, so you can build apps from an app.
- A startup called a0 [launched a v0-like service](https://a0.dev) to generate RN apps.
