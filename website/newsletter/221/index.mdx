Hi everyone!

Cyril and Matthieu from [Theodo Apps](https://apps.theodo.com/en?utm_source=thisweekinreact) here 👋, standing in for Seb to bring you the latest news from React and React Native!

This week we’ve been carefully reading the State of React results, and also found quite a few interesting articles. Things have been quieter when it comes to new releases.

App.js, the biggest React Native conference, will take place between May 28th and May 30th. The CFP is currently open, you can apply from [their website](https://appjs.co). See you in Kraków?

[![State of React 2024](/emails/issues/221/state-of-react.png)](https://2024.stateofreact.com)

**[State of React 2024](https://2024.stateofreact.com)**

The results of State of React 2024 are out. It is a gold mine of information and we can’t possibly talk about everything here but here are a few highlights:

- Of the “new” React features, Server components are the most popular with 40% of the ~7000 respondents having “used it”, probably thanks to Next.js…
- Have you heard about React’s Taint API? It looks like 80% of React devs have not, which is understandable since it’s experimental.
- There’s not that much movement in the \#1 spot: Next.js, TanStack Query, Axios, Jest, and Zod are still the most frequently used.
- A few rising stars: Zustand and Vitest got more users, TanStack Start is \#1 in interest even though almost no one has used it yet.

Seb wrote the conclusion of the survey, make sure to check it out 🙂.

- 📜 [Why I rebuilt ProseMirror’s renderer in React](https://smoores.dev/post/why_i_rebuilt_prosemirror_view/): Prosemirror (a text editor) manages its own state and virtual DOM, and it did not play well with React. This is a deep dive on the issues it caused, and the solution: using React directly instead of trying to “bridge the gap”.
- 📜 [Promises across the void: Streaming data with RSC](https://edspencer.net/2024/7/12/promises-across-the-void-react-server-components): React can send not-yet resolved promises from the server and finish awaiting them on the client. This article from a few months ago explains how this works.

[![Bolt x Expo](/emails/issues/221/bolt-expo.jpg)](https://expo.dev/blog/bolt-expo-integration-announcement)

**Building apps with AI**

We try not to talk too much about LLMs in this newsletter (we guess you already hear about it more than enough 😅) but with all the announcements this week we thought it was a good time to give you an update.

The main thing: [Bolt and Expo have partnered](https://expo.dev/blog/bolt-expo-integration-announcement) to add (React-)Native mobile apps support to Bolt. Right now you can preview your AI-generated apps on the web, but you need to download the code to go further. They plan to add an integration with EAS to deploy to production in the future.

Some competitors also had things to announce:

- There's now an official Expo template in Replit, and [a demo video you can watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTm_dCF53qk). Replit has an app, so you can build apps from an app.
- A startup called a0 [launched a v0-like service](https://a0.dev) to generate RN apps.
