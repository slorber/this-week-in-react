Hi everyone!

Cyril and Matthieu from Theodo Apps here 👋, standing in for Seb to bring you the latest news from React and React Native!

The previous edition was last Friday, so this one will be a bit shorter than usual. We’re resuming the usual pace of one newsletter every week after the holidays.

The [2024 edition of JS rising stars](https://risingstars.js.org/2024/en) is out, you can start by having a look at which libraries performed well on this flawed but still useful metric of GitHub starts. Spoiler: `shadcn/ui` gained the most stars (again). Sébastien commented the [Tooling section](https://risingstars.js.org/2024/en#section-build).

Make sure to check our partner 🗓️ [Paris TypeScript La Conf'](https://la-conf.typescript.paris/?utm_source=thisweekinreact) - 🇫🇷 Paris - 28 February - Full speaker line up just dropped! Join Mateusz Burzyński, Elise Patrikainen and David Rousset! Get 20% off tickets with code "TWIR"!
