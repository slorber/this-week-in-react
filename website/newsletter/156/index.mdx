Stream is the maker of enterprise-grade **APIs** and **SDKs** that help product and engineering teams solve two common problems at scale: in-app chat and social activity feeds.

With Stream, developers can integrate any type of messaging or feed experience into their app in a fraction of the time it would take to build these features from scratch. Stream Chat makes it easy for developers to integrate rich, real-time messaging into their applications.

Stream provides robust client-side SDKs for popular frameworks such as [**React**](https://getstream.io/chat/sdk/react/?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=sponsorship&utm_content=&utm_campaign=thisweekinreact_July2023_video_klmh22), [**React-Native**](https://getstream.io/chat/sdk/react-native/?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=sponsorship&utm_content=&utm_campaign=thisweekinreact_July2023_video_klmh22), Expo, Flutter, Android, Angular, Compose, Unreal, and iOS.
Unlock enterprise-grade features, functions, and UI components completely free for your startup or side project with the Maker Account.
