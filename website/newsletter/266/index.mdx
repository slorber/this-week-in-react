Hi everyone!

This week, the community continued to publish React-related Agent skills. React RSCs and Next.js are hit by another set of DoS vulnerabilities, and it’s recommended to upgrade immediately.

The React Native side is more exciting, with Expo SDK 55 in beta and upcoming support for new CSS features. We now have 2 distinct libraries implementing home screen widgets, and need to understand the trade-offs of each approach.
