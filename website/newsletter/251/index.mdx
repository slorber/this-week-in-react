Hi everyone!

**Krzysztof and Tymek from [Software Mansion](https://swmansion.com/?utm_source=thisweekinreact)** here\! 👋

In this issue, we have a bit less than usual news from React Native for you. Perhaps this is because the calendar autumn has begun (and the world overall has become gloomy), or maybe it's because there is a slight silence that heralds a storm in our React world? 😉

Nevertheless, there is always something to talk about, especially in the context of React – There's new documentation about a newly released plugin for React Hooks, and in Next.js we will soon see a new component caching feature using the `cacheComponents` prop\!

We hope you enjoy this edition, and that during this cloudy season, each of you will stay healthy\!  
Let's get started\! 🤗

[**Announcing TanStack Start v1**](https://tanstack.com/blog/announcing-tanstack-start-v1)

On September 23, the TanStack team announced their new full-stack framework. TanStack Start is built on the widely known TanStack Router and was designed with server rendering, streaming, and production-ready deployments in mind.

Key features of TanStack Start include a completely type-safe routing system that can handle complex, full-stack routing requirements, built-in support for full-document Server-Side Rendering, streaming, server functions and is designed for flexibility, allowing you to deploy your application in any environment that can run JavaScript.

You can try out TanStack Start today, by installing the Release Candidate version with the instructions provided [here](https://tanstack.com/start/latest/docs/framework/react/quick-start).
