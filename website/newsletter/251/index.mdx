Hi everyone!

**Krzysztof and Tymek from [Software Mansion](https://swmansion.com/?utm_source=thisweekinreact)** here\! 👋

In this issue, as always, we have some great news prepared for you. On the React side, TanStack Start has been announced in Release Candidate, React Router expands RSC support to its Framework Mode, and the official ESLint plugin for React Hooks is now exhaustively documented.

However, on the React Native side, we have a bit less than usual news for you. Perhaps this is because autumn has begun (and the world overall has become gloomy), or maybe it's because there is a slight silence that heralds a storm in our React world?

Well, as we know, React Conf is coming up, so everyone is probably postponing their announcements and releases until October 7\. 😉

We hope you enjoy this edition and that during this cloudy season, each of you will stay healthy\!  
Let's get started\! 🤗

[![](/emails/issues/251/tanstackstart.jpg)](https://tanstack.com/blog/announcing-tanstack-start-v1)

[**Announcing TanStack Start 1.0 - Release Candidate**](https://tanstack.com/blog/announcing-tanstack-start-v1)

On September 23, the TanStack team announced their new full-stack framework. TanStack Start is built on the widely known TanStack Router and was designed with server rendering, streaming, and production-ready deployments in mind.

Key features of TanStack Start include a completely type-safe routing system that can handle complex, full-stack routing requirements, built-in support for full-document Server-Side Rendering, streaming, server functions, and is designed for flexibility, allowing you to deploy your application in any environment that runs JavaScript.

You can try out TanStack Start today by installing the Release Candidate version with the instructions provided [here](https://tanstack.com/start/latest/docs/framework/react/quick-start).

[![](/emails/issues/251/frameworkmode.jpg)](https://remix.run/blog/rsc-framework-mode-preview)

[**React Router RSC Framework Mode Preview**](https://remix.run/blog/rsc-framework-mode-preview)

We already had a preview of React Server Components for the Data Mode in React Router 7.7. With the latest release v7.9.2, React Router completes this preview by expanding RSC support to its Framework Mode.

In case you are unfamiliar with React Router modes, the post gives a quick overview. The Data Mode is quite flexible, but lower-level. The Framework Mode gives a more streamlined developer experience, managing many things for you thanks to a new unstable `unstable_reactRouterRSC` Vite plugin that works alongside the new official Vite RSC plugin.

Although full RSC support is coming later, these Vite plugins already enable the following features:

- Return Server Components for loaders and actions.
- Create Server Component routes.
- Use `”use client”` (Client Component) and `”use server”` (Server Functions) directives.
