Hi everyone!

Gatsby has just been acquired by Netlify 🤯!

There is also a very interesting RFC to read if you are passionate about cross-platform in React-Native.

Otherwise, it's a pretty quiet week. That's good timing, because I don't have much time 😄. I'm finishing up some preparations for next week's email which will be a bit different.

[![Netlify Acquires Gatsby Inc. to Accelerate Adoption of Composable Web Architectures](/emails/issues/134/netlify-gatsby.jpg)](https://www.netlify.com/press/netlify-acquires-gatsby-inc-to-accelerate-adoption-of-composable-web-architectures/)

**[Netlify Acquires Gatsby Inc. to Accelerate Adoption of Composable Web Architectures](https://www.netlify.com/press/netlify-acquires-gatsby-inc-to-accelerate-adoption-of-composable-web-architectures/)**

This is the big news of the week. Gatsby Inc. bought by Netlify. The framework is now under the Netlify umbrella alongside Eleventy and SolidJS and will continue to evolve. The cloud features (including the [Valhalla Content Hub](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/products/valhalla-content-hub/)) will be integrated into Netlify's offerings. The new slogan is "composable architecture". Gatsby is not the most popular React framework right now, but I think this acquisition makes sense, especially for the content hub and all the CMS integrations they have been working on. The Gatsby Cloud offering is harder to adopt than an optional paid features on Netlify, and that's even more true for sites that don't use Gatsby as a framework.

[![Making state machines global in React](/emails/issues/134/xstate.jpg)](https://stately.ai/blog/making-state-machines-global-in-react)

**[Making state machines global in React](https://stately.ai/blog/making-state-machines-global-in-react)**

Presentation of the new `createActorContext` API appearing in XState 3.1. It allows to facilitate the creation of global XState state machines, associated to a React context. It is possible to use a selector system, or to provide a custom state machine to the provider (this looks convenient to customize a machine from parent `props`).

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

[![React DOM for Native (reduce API fragmentation)](/emails/issues/134/rn-web.jpg)](https://github.com/necolas/discussions-and-proposals/blob/reduce-fragmentation/proposals/0000-reduce-fragmentation.md)

**[React DOM for Native (reduce API fragmentation)](https://github.com/necolas/discussions-and-proposals/blob/reduce-fragmentation/proposals/0000-reduce-fragmentation.md)**

The [RFC](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/pull/496) by Nicolas Gallagher (Meta / React-Native-Web) has just been updated. The goal is to align React-Native APIs as much as possible with Web APIs, including DOM elements like `div`, `span` and even `select`! The "learn once, run everywhere" could gradually turn into "write once, run everywhere". The community is quite divided. We'll have to sleep on it a bit know if it's a good idea 😄, and considering the size of this ambitious project, it's clearly not for tomorrow!
