Hi everyone!

After a little break, we're catching up on 2 weeks of news this week!

There's been quite a few releases, including Remix and Next.js, but also some lesser-known packages that are well worth your attention.

Super excited to see Expo finally venturing server-side!

[![Remix v2](/emails/issues/160/remix-v2.jpg)](https://remix.run/blog/remix-v2)

[**Remix v2**](https://remix.run/blog/remix-v2)

As expected, Remix v2 should be a relatively straightforward upgrade, since many v2 features were already available in v1 as opt-in 'future flags'. This article gives an overview of all the flags that were delivered in v1 and are now enabled by default in v2. Remix also offers retro-compatibility packages for those who preferred some v1 conventions. React Server Component support should land in Remix v3.

[**Next.js 13.5**](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13-5)

Many developers complained about the slowness of the Next.js dev server lately. Vercel heard us and came up with another rlease that significantly improves things.

[![Expo Router RFC - API Routes](/emails/issues/160/expo-api-routes.jpg)](https://blog.expo.dev/rfc-api-routes-cce5a3b9f25d)

[**Expo Router RFC - API Routes**](https://blog.expo.dev/rfc-api-routes-cce5a3b9f25d)

I've been looking forward to this! Expo is getting into server-side features by offering to deploy API Routes via an Expo Router convention. You can deploy these routes yourself, and soon on popular hosts, but it's clear that the long-term goal is to suggest hosting the server runtime in EAS.

This marks the start of a new era for Expo. Having solved the problem of native mobile, it's now time to make cross-platform a mainstream reality by filling the gaps in web support with Server Side Rendering and React Server Components.
