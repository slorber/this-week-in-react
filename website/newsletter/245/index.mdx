Hi everyone!

This week, we have a few interesting React releases, many of them from the TanStack ecosystem. I also found great articles and interesting PRs to look at.

On the React Native side, reducing iOS build times will be a very welcome improvement, and Rozenite could significantly improve the React Native DX too\!

The newsletter will be taking a well-deserved 2-week break 🏝️  
We'll be back on August 20\. Until then, keep Reacting ✌️

[Stop Re-Rendering — TanStack DB, the Embedded Client Database for TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/blog/tanstack-db-0.1-the-embedded-client-database-for-tanstack-query)

TanStack DB 0.1 is out in beta, 🐦 [completing the vision Tanner Linsley had for React Quey from day 1](https://x.com/tannerlinsley/status/1950262878852043103). Unlike Query, which treats data as isolated cache entries, DB provides the missing reactive layer and lets you create relationships between collections, using differential dataflow — a technique that only recomputes the parts of queries that actually changed. TanStack DB was designed from the ground up to support sync engines, but it is incrementally adoptable and compatible with REST, GraphQL or anything else.

- 👀 [React Core PR \- Deprecate "Throw a Promise" technique](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/34032): This old technique to trigger Suspense boundaries should be deprecated and emit a warning in an upcoming release. You’d rather migrate your code to `React.use(promise)` instead. Maintainers of libraries like React Query [wonder how to support both React v18 and v19](https://bsky.app/profile/tkdodo.eu/post/3lv4rhr4mrs2i).
- 👀 [React Core PR \- Expose `cacheSignal()`](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/33557): According to [newly merged typedefs](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/73243), an upcoming React canary could expose a way to retrieve an `AbortSignal` that triggers at the end of the `React.cache()` lifetime, letting you abort any outstanding network requests.
- 👀 [Next.js PR \- Initial MCP implementation](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/81770): Starting 15.4.2-canary.16, `next dev` can expose an MCP server if you use Turbopack and provide a `NEXT_EXPERIMENTAL_MCP_SECRET` env variable. Tools enable querying the module graph, entry points, and issues reported on routes.

- 📜 [The Useless useCallback](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/the-useless-use-callback): Shows how easy it is to inadvertently break your `React.memo` optimizations and your `useEffect` behavior due to referential stability issues. IMO, React optimizations should be encapsulated; they shouldn't depend on how a component/hook is used to work, but it’s easier said than done.
- 📜 [How Parcel bundles React Server Components](https://devongovett.me/blog/parcel-rsc.html): Great overview of how a bundler like Parcel works, and how it splits code and preloads it efficiently in an RSC setup depending on dynamic imports and \`use client\` directives.
- 📜 [We’ve moved from TanStack Start to](https://llmgateway.io/changelog/nextjs-migration?v=2) [Next.js](http://Next.js): It’s a product changelog entry, but you’ll find [more interesting discussions on X](https://x.com/tannerlinsley/status/1950310182451630384).

- 📦 [TanStack Router 1.130 \- Add `disableGlobalCatchBoundary` option](https://github.com/TanStack/router/releases/tag/v1.130.0): This lets errors bubble up, useful for tests or error reporting.

[Precompiled React Native for iOS: Faster builds are coming in 0.81](https://expo.dev/blog/precompiled-react-native-for-ios)

iOS React Native builds are about to become much faster. With 0.81, it will be possible to use precompiled versions of React Native and its dependencies, similarly to what is already done on Android. For now, it’s behind an opt-in flag in 0.81. But Expo 54, at the end of August, will use precompiled versions by default.

The result is impressive, **reducing the build time of the RNTester app by 10x**. On a larger application such as Expo Go, results are more modest, with a \~37% improvement. Expo is not yet precompiling its Expo Modules, so we can expect Expo Go and real world Expo apps to build much faster soon. Third-party lib authors will also be encouraged to ship prebuilt versions.

- 👀 [React Native PR \- Enable `enableEagerAlternateStateNodeCleanup`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/51856): React Native retains shadow nodes longer than it needs, and this eager cleanup could significantly reduce memory usage in upcoming versions of React Native.

It comes with pre-built plugins (React Query, MMKV, Redux, Expo Atlas, Network), and a plugin marketplace is coming. This looks like a good idea to have a modern alternative to Flipper.
