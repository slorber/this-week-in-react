Hey,

this is Benedikt, filling in for Sébastien this week who’s on a well-deserved vacation (right after releasing Docusaurus 3.4). React 19 is nearing its final release, with the first RC published this week. Apart from this, there’s not a lot of release activity in the React and React Native communities. So this week, I decided to feature two great pieces of content as headlines in both sections. A seminal 10k-word-long article about Data Fetching Patterns in Single-Page Applications by Juntao Qiu, and a great video overview of all the different ways to build React Native apps with Expo by Simon Grimm.

I wanted to use this opportunity to let you know that both Sébastien and I put a lot of effort into finding the best content for the React and React Native sections, but I’m sure there is still great stuff that sometimes goes unnoticed. That’s why we’re always open to suggestions, so feel free to let us know when you put something out there!

📜 **[Data Fetching Patterns in Single-Page Applications](https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-fetch-spa.html)**

This is a long read (~10k words), but such a great article! The title doesn’t do its justice, because in passing, this covers so much more than just data fetching. Basic React concepts, Suspense, async state handling, code splitting, prefetching, and parallel data fetching to avoid waterfalls. There has been a lot of discussion on X about web app performance in the last few weeks (Rails vs. React, MS Edge decision, …) - this is a great article to freshen up the basics of this topic to build a great user experience!

![Simon Grimm: Build React Native with Expo](/emails/issues/188/rn188.jpg)

🎥 **[Every Way to Build your React Native App with Expo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs-zgHjt5RQ)**

Many roads lead to Rome, and it seems there are almost as many ways to build an Expo app. This gives us developers a lot of power and freedom, but can also sometimes lead to confusion - not just for beginners! Thankfully, Simon made a great video comparing the different approaches via Expo Go, Expo Prebuild, Xcode, Android Studio, and EAS. This is also a great opportunity to congratulate Expo on reaching [30k stars on GitHub!](https://x.com/expo/status/1796262781584654492)
