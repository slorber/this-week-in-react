Hi everyone! Kacper and Tymek from **[Software Mansion](https://swmansion.com/?utm_source=thisweekinreact)** here! 👋

This week, TanStack Pacer debuts in Beta, a new framework-agnostic library for controlling function timing with a dedicated React adapter. Lots of interesting articles featuring a 20,000x improvement in TanStack Router route matching algorithm speed, tips to speeding up Next.js on Kubernetes, and tutorial for React 19 Actions for better component responsiveness.

On the React Native side, we'd like to highlight an incredibly detailed blog post on Vercel's breakdown of building the v0 iOS app.

Enjoy the read!

**[Why is internationalization so hard?](https://learn.next-intl.dev/?discountCode=TWIRCZMG)**

How do you set up i18n in Next.js so it feels built-in — not bolted on? In [learn.next-intl.dev](https://learn.next-intl.dev/?discountCode=TWIRCZMG), Jan Amann (maintainer of next-intl) distills years of hard-won lessons into practical patterns you can apply today:

- 🌍 **I18n ≠ translations** — Understand the pieces that make a truly localized experience
- **🧩Architecture that scales** — Routing, locales, time zones & currencies done right
- **🚀The full picture** — Backend, CMS, SEO, dev tooling, AI translations & more

A new framework-agnostic library has just landed from the TanStack hands. It offers high-quality utilities for controlling function execution timing, including debouncing, throttling, rate limiting, batching, and more.

It provides a dedicated React adapter (`@tanstack/react-pacer`), which gives you a set of easy-to-use hooks on top of the core Pacer utilities, such as `useDebouncedValue`, `useThrottledValue`, `useQueuedState,` or `useBatcher`.  
It also gives you the ability to debug the code via [TanStack Devtools](https://tanstack.com/pacer/latest/docs/devtools).

You can read more about the TanStack Pacer's adapter for React [here](https://tanstack.com/pacer/latest/docs/framework/react/adapter).
