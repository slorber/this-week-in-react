**[Why is internationalization so hard?](https://learn.next-intl.dev/?discountCode=TWIRCZMG)**

How do you set up i18n in Next.js so it feels built-in — not bolted on? In [learn.next-intl.dev](https://learn.next-intl.dev/?discountCode=TWIRCZMG), Jan Amann (maintainer of next-intl) distills years of hard-won lessons into practical patterns you can apply today:

- 🌍 **I18n ≠ translations** — Understand the pieces that make a truly localized experience
- **🧩Architecture that scales** — Routing, locales, time zones & currencies done right
- **🚀The full picture** — Backend, CMS, SEO, dev tooling, AI translations & more

[Now 40% off](https://learn.next-intl.dev/?discountCode=TWIRCZMG) during the Black Friday week!
