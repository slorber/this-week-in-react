Hi everyone!

We're gradually coming out of the holiday season. There are quite a few blog posts; but no major announcements apart from React-Native 0.71.

I'm back from a ski vacation and back on the weekly newsletter schedule. I didn't follow everything but I think the Twitter drama of the week was about Tailwind? 😅

Only 2 days left to take the [State of React-Native survey](https://survey.stateofreactnative.com/) 🙏

For creative web devs interested in React-Three-Fiber, subscribe to the [Web Game Dev](https://www.webgamedev.com/newsletter) newsletter: you will find more info than here.

**[React Bricks is a CMS with visual editing based on React components](https://reactbricks.com/?utm_source=this_week_in_react)**

**It's flexible for Developers**: create your own design system using React components, add Visual editing in your JSX and add sidebar controls to edit props like the background color. Choose Next.js, Gatsby or Remix and any CSS framework you like!

**It's easy for Content editors** who can directly edit in a visual way without breaking the design system: much easier than editing abstract entities using gray fields, as in a headless CMS. **And you save time**, as Content editors are autonomous!

**It's enterprise-ready** with Collaboration, Time-machine, Single Sign-on, GDPR-compliant datacenters, Global CDN for optimized images, E-commerce integration, Scheduled publishing and more.

[![useReducer](/emails/issues/131/useReducer.jpg)](https://www.builder.io/blog/use-reducer)

**[A Cure for useState Hell](https://www.builder.io/blog/use-reducer)**

Proposes to replace several `useState` with a `useReducer` with a single action. He explains the advantages, like the possibility to make sure the state is consistent, or to migrate later to a reducer with several actions. An interesting pattern to know. My opinion: it is quite possible to get similar benefits by using a single `useState` with a single object and a custom hook. `useState` or `useReducer` should be an implementation detail.

[![useReducer](/emails/issues/131/react-query-ts.jpg)](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/type-safe-react-query)

**[Type-safe React Query](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/type-safe-react-query)**

With TypeScript, you'd rather not fool yourself. Can we trust our backend to return the right payload. Dominik suggests combining React-Query with Zod. With inference, it is no longer necessary to force a type with `as` or generics. We can use tRPC or Zodios in a fullstack environment when the backend and frontend are in the same monorepo.
