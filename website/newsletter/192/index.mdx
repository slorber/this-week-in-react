Hi everyone!

The newsletter is back after a well-deserved 2-weeks break!

So we're covering three weeks of news in one issue, and there are too many links to squeeze into one e-mail, so I had to filter out the news more aggressively. Despite the holiday season, we had a lot of great community React articles, and quite interesting React Native news!

If you really like the exhaustive side of this newsletter, I'd encourage you to check the [online version](https://thisweekinreact.com/newsletter/192) this time: it exceptionally contains extra sections with twice more links that you might still find interesting. This also gives you a hint of the value I provide: the work you don't see is all the articles that I gathered and read/skimmed over and had to filter out.

Check out our partner conf [React-Brussels](https://www.react.brussels/?utm_source=thisweekinreact) (🇧🇪 Brussels - 18 October), offering us a 10% discount with code “TWIR”. Some speakers have already been revealed!

[![The Category-Defining React Grid for Your Enterprise](/emails/issues/190/advertfinal.jpg)](https://1771technologies.com/graphitegrid)

**[The Category-Defining React Grid for Your Enterprise](https://1771technologies.com/graphitegrid)**

Data grids are complex components of web applications, but current solutions are inefficient, require a lot of maintenance, and perform poorly. [Graphite Grid](https://1771technologies.com/graphitegrid) transforms the landscape with two key features: retargetable rendering and reactive signal state.

**Graphite Grid** separates grid state from view logic, allowing a single unified state model to support a variety of render targets, declaratively or imperatively. It includes a **DOM and Canvas** renderer, giving developers flexible, high-performance options 🚀.

Graphite Grid is declarative and consistent, leveraging state signals to ensure seamless integration with your application. Designed with **React in mind**, it is the only JavaScript data grid built with React's state management primitives. [Try it now!](https://1771technologies.com/graphitegrid/demo)

[![Remix - Fog of War](/emails/issues/192/rr.jpg)](https://remix.run/blog/fog-of-war)

**[Remix - Fog of War](https://remix.run/blog/fog-of-war)**

We already featured this in our last issue, but there’s now a dedicated blog post that greatly explains what it’s all about. A new React Router feature enables you to split your route manifest in chunks. This article explains how it has been integrated in Remix 2.10 and what are the tradeoffs. It turns out a route manifest can grow quite large, and if you don’t split it, it might delay your app’s React hydration because it has to be downloaded upfront. If you have a medium/large Remix or React Router site, I’d recommend to check the size your route manifest immediately, and think about logical ways to split it, because the size reduction this new feature enable can have a significant perf impact. Shopify’s initial manifest went from 10MB to 1.9KB! The Docusaurus website manifest is also 200KB and I definitively plan to implement this.

- 👀 [React Core PR - `ReactHTML.renderToMarkup`](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/30105): A new `react-html`package is being introduced for producing HTML that’s not meant to be hydrated (like emails). It’s the successor of`renderToStaticMarkup`, supporting modern features like Suspense.
- 👀 [React Core PR - `React.captureOwnerStack()`](http://github.com/facebook/react/pull/29923): From many PRs I see, a lot of effort is going on in the React repo to improve debugging, logging, and producing readable “component owner stack traces”. This new public API should be useful for framework authors to display an error dialog.
- 👀 [Next.js PR - TypeScript config file (`next.config.ts`)](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/63051): A welcome improvement for DX to have first-class TypeScript support in config files, not anymore limited to JSDoc comments.

- 📜 [Sneaky React Memory Leaks: How the React compiler won't save you](http://schiener.io/2024-07-07/react-closures-compiler): This closes a great 3-part series on memory leaks in React. Kevin found a case where using the React Compiler would actually introduce a memory leak to code that wouldn’t leak otherwise. Using bind might be a decent workaround. Note that these memory issues are not limited to React, but happen due to using functional programming and closures in JS in general.
- 📜 [How to Simplify Component Imports with TypeScript Namespaces](https://sergiodxa.com/tutorials/simplify-component-imports-with-typescript-namespaces): I admit I didn’t know this quite pragmatic React + TypeScript trick that [Matt Pocock also approves](https://x.com/mattpocockuk/status/1805606072167940167).
- 📜 [How to protect against a security breach in React Server Components](https://www.nodejs-security.com/blog/how-to-protect-against-a-security-breach-in-react-server-components): Greatly illustrates that validating with Zod is not enough, and it’s important to check access control for any server action input.
- 📜 [WorkOS - Migrating to Next.js App Router with zero downtime](https://workos.com/blog/migrating-to-next-js-app-router-with-zero-downtime): An incremental migration from pages to App Router does not give a great navigation UX. They found a clever way to expose the same app as both Pages Router and App Router, with the ability to switch routers through a query string param.
- 📜 [Enhancing The New York Times Web Performance with React 18](https://open.nytimes.com/enhancing-the-new-york-times-web-performance-with-react-18-d6f91a7c5af8): They migrated from React 16 and see great benefits such as fewer re-renders and improved INP score. Also encountered some challenges due to stricter hydration requirements.

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

[![react-native-filament](/emails/issues/192/filament.jpg)](https://github.com/margelo/react-native-filament)

**[react-native-filament](https://github.com/margelo/react-native-filament)**

The Margelo team released an impressive new real-time physically based 3D rendering engine for React Native, based on Google Filament. It’s GPU-accelerated by Metal/Vulkan, rendered on a separate thread, works with Reanimated, and already supports the New Architecture and Expo. The readme explains well how it differs from existing 3D solutions based on expo-gl (expo-three and react-three-fiber RN). With Skia and Filament, the future looks bright for React Native's 2D/3D capabilities.

[![Rise Tools](/emails/issues/192/rise.jpg)](https://rise.tools/)

**[Rise Tools](https://rise.tools/)**

A brand-new solution to create Server Driven UIs in React Native, that allows you to deploy new views on the server without rebuilding/resubmitting your app (or even ship an OTA update). It looks philosophically very close to the React Server Components model, but with slightly different tradeoffs: at the cost of some additional manual wiring, this new solution is framework and language agnostic thanks to a protocol that defines how views are serialized. It's still early days, but it looks promising.
