Hi everyone!

This week, you probably didn't miss the Next.js middleware drama, but that wasn't the only thing going on!

We also got many great releases such as tRPC, React Query, Rsdoctor and more!

Also, React Native is 10 years old today! 🥳

**[Convex: The Database Designed for AI Coding](https://convex.link/thisweekai)**

In the age of code generation, you need a backend that you can confidently generate with AI platforms. Convex is by far and away [best in class](https://stack.convex.dev/introducing-fullstack-bench) in this respect.

This is because Convex is just TypeScript, allowing you to write [queries as code](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions/) that are automatically transactional, cached, and realtime.

And that’s just the beginning. With Convex, you can:

- Easily schedule functions and write cron jobs
- Set up file storage
- Write efficient server functions
- And so much more…

[![Postmortem on Next.js Middleware bypass](/emails/issues/227/middleware.png)](https://vercel.com/blog/postmortem-on-next-js-middleware-bypass)

**[Postmortem on Next.js Middleware bypass](https://vercel.com/blog/postmortem-on-next-js-middleware-bypass)**

A few days ago, Vercel announced a critical 9.1 vulnerability in Next.js middleware system. With a simple but malicious `x-middleware-subrequest` header, you can bypass the middleware, possibly exposing sensitive information. Patches are available for Next.js 12/13/14/15. Note that this vulnerability only affects self-hosted apps using `output: ‘standalone’` and `next start` are affected. Customers of major serverless cloud providers are either not affected (Vercel, Netlify), or protection can be turned on (Cloudflare).

It's worth noting that even though Next.js middleware shouldn’t have this vulnerability, it is [not the recommended place to manage user sessions and protect routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/authentication#optimistic-checks-with-middleware-optional), and shouldn’t be the only line of defense in your Next.js app. The middleware is more designed to perform lightweight optimistic checks, eventually rewriting/redirecting without hitting any DB.

This security event has caused a lot of drama in the ecosystem, which I'd rather not comment on much. Vercel could have handled the situation better, and they plan to do better in the future. I’ll let you make your own opinion based on various resources, and there’s too many, so this is just a subset:

- 📜 [Next.js and the corrupt middleware: the authorizing artifact](https://zhero-web-sec.github.io/research-and-things/nextjs-and-the-corrupt-middleware): The original article from the security researchers who found the vulnerability.

- 📜 [Authorization in Next.js](https://www.robinwieruch.de/next-authorization/): Robin explains how he approaches authorization in Next.js projects, as close to the sensitive data as possible.

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

![React Native turns 10](/emails/issues/227/rn-10.jpg)

**React Native turns 10\! 🎉🤯**

Believe it or not, React Native was [open-sourced exactly 10 years ago](https://engineering.fb.com/2015/03/26/android/react-native-bringing-modern-web-techniques-to-mobile/), and React Native is celebrating its first decade today\!

A huge shoutout to everyone who made it happen\! Let’s take the opportunity to listen again to [this podcast episode with Christopher Chedeau](https://youtu.be/_cBqGenDCks?si=nrfF4D_FGEJhQsH3&t=1504) (Vjeux, co-creator of React Native) where he explains the backstory of React Native, and how this great project could easily have died without ambitious people willing to bet on it.

Also a shoutout to the amazing React Native community—tight-knit, always pushing forward, tackling challenges, and building the future of native declarative UI together 🚀

To the next promising decade\! 🥂
