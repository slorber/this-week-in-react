**[Convex: The Database Designed for AI Coding](https://convex.link/thisweekai)**

In the age of code generation, you need a backend that you can confidently generate with AI platforms. Convex is by far and away [best in class](https://stack.convex.dev/introducing-fullstack-bench) in this respect.

This is because Convex is just TypeScript, allowing you to write [queries as code](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions/) that are automatically transactional, cached, and realtime.

And that’s just the beginning. With Convex, you can:

- Easily schedule functions and write cron jobs
- Set up file storage
- Write efficient server functions
- And so much more…

[Postmortem on Next.js Middleware bypass](https://vercel.com/blog/postmortem-on-next-js-middleware-bypass)

A few days ago, Vercel announced a critical 9.1 vulnerability in Next.js middleware system. With a simple but malicious `x-middleware-subrequest` header, you can bypass the middleware, possibly exposing sensitive information. Patches are available for Next.js 12/13/14/15. Note that this vulnerability only affects self-hosted apps using `output: ‘standalone’` and `next start` are affected. Customers of major serverless cloud providers are either not affected (Vercel, Netlify), or protection can be turned on (Cloudflare).

It's worth noting that even though Next.js middleware shouldn’t have this vulnerability, it is [not the recommended place to manage user sessions and protect routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/authentication#optimistic-checks-with-middleware-optional), and shouldn’t be the only line of defense in your Next.js app. The middleware is more designed to perform lightweight optimistic checks, eventually rewriting/redirecting without hitting any DB.

This security event has caused a lot of drama in the ecosystem, which I'd rather not comment on much. Vercel could have handled the situation better, and they plan to do better in the future. I’ll let you make your own opinion based on various resources, and there’s too many, so this is just a subset:

- 📜 [Next.js and the corrupt middleware: the authorizing artifact](https://zhero-web-sec.github.io/research-and-things/nextjs-and-the-corrupt-middleware): The original article from the security researchers who found the vulnerability.
- 📜 [How to Think About Security in Next.js](https://nextjs.org/blog/security-nextjs-server-components-actions): Older post but still a relevant read today.
- 📜 [Authorization in Next.js](https://www.robinwieruch.de/next-authorization/): Robin explains how he approaches authorization in Next.js projects, as close to the sensitive data as possible.
- 📜 [You should know this before choosing Next.js](https://eduardoboucas.com/posts/2025-03-25-you-should-know-this-before-choosing-nextjs/): The perspective from Netlify’s Principal Engineer.
- 🎥 [Theo \- Next.js security exploit](https://www.youtube.com/live/UbcrphhSAIs?si=QgihLKnhpyE3RxPO&t=8243): A 1h stream that on this topic, also explaining what Vercel did wrong.
