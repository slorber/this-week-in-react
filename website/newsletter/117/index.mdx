Hi everyone!

This week we have some interesting React criticisms to read.

We also have various interesting routing-related news: Next.js, React-Router, Expo...

The newsletter **is finally back to its usual weekly rhythm**! I'm just back from vacations, and I took the opportunity to change my email provider: I'm now using [ConvertKit](https://thisweekinreact.com/ck). This gives me more flexibility on the email rendering and will allow me to introduce some new features later ;)

## ⚛️ React {#react}

**[React I Love You, But You're Bringing Me Down](https://marmelab.com/blog/2022/09/20/react-i-love-you.html)**

The author of React-Admin gives a fair criticism of React on many aspects (forms, useContextSelector, refs, deps array...). Don't miss [Dan Abramov's response](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1572590212647391235).

**[Next.js Layouts RFC in 5 minutes](https://vercel.com/blog/next-js-layouts-rfc-in-5-minutes)**

The file-system based Next.js router will be significantly upgraded in the next major release. It includes support for nested layouts (like in Remix). This allows to avoid unnecessary unmount/remount of a layout during browsing, but also to manage data loading and errors. This article gives a quick overview. See also [Delba's thread](https://twitter.com/delba_oliveira/status/1568291558776274945).

**[React Router 6.4](https://remix.run/blog/react-router-v6.4)**

Big update: as expected, many Remix APIs (data-loading, mutation...) have finally been moved to React-Router. See the [2min video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX74DbFT5nI)

**[What’s New In Gatsby 2022?](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/09/new-gatsby-2022/)**

Paul upgraded his blog to the latest Gatsby v4 version and shares with us how he used the latest features. Deferred Static Generation can significantly reduce build time. See also [Gatsby 5 Umbrella Discussion](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/36609) and the video [Gatsby v5 Alpha Showcase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-WrnfUm33k): partial hydration is coming!

**Extras**:

- 🧑‍🎓Beta docs: [useCallback](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1570021510659579904) + [useMemo](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1568602727147520000)
- 💬 [useEvent update](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/220#issuecomment-1259938816): the `useEvent` prototype is implemented and available via `@experimental`. Some concerns will lead to the opening of a new RFC. If I understand correctly it is possible that this hook will never be released but another solution will be adopted.

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

**[RFC: File System-Based Native Routing with Expo and React Native](https://blog.expo.dev/rfc-file-system-based-routing-in-react-native-7a35474722a)**

Evan Bacon is working on a new Expo router based on file-system conventions, similar to Next.js or Remix. He tells us all we need to know about this highly anticipated feature that brings the DX of the web to mobile. This should considerably reduce the boilerplate of our apps, but also improve discoverability, deep linking, indexing, loading data, error handling...
