This week we have some interesting React criticisms to read.

We also have various interesting routing-related news: Next.js, React-Router, Expo...

The newsletter **is finally back to its usual weekly rhythm**! I'm just back from vacations, and I took the opportunity to change my email provider: I'm now using [ConvertKit](https://thisweekinreact.com/ck). This gives me more flexibility on the email rendering and will allow me to introduce some new features later ;)
