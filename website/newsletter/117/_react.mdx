**[React I Love You, But You're Bringing Me Down](https://marmelab.com/blog/2022/09/20/react-i-love-you.html)**

The author of React-Admin gives a fair criticism of React on many aspects (forms, useContextSelector, refs, deps array...). Don't miss [Dan Abramov's response](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1572590212647391235).

**[Next.js Layouts RFC in 5 minutes](https://vercel.com/blog/next-js-layouts-rfc-in-5-minutes)**

The file-system based Next.js router will be significantly upgraded in the next major release. It includes support for nested layouts (like in Remix). This allows to avoid unnecessary unmount/remount of a layout during browsing, but also to manage data loading and errors. This article gives a quick overview. See also [Delba's thread](https://twitter.com/delba_oliveira/status/1568291558776274945).

**[React Router 6.4](https://remix.run/blog/react-router-v6.4)**

Big update: as expected, many Remix APIs (data-loading, mutation...) have finally been moved to React-Router. See the [2min video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX74DbFT5nI)

**[What’s New In Gatsby 2022?](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/09/new-gatsby-2022/)**

Paul upgraded his blog to the latest Gatsby v4 version and shares with us how he used the latest features. Deferred Static Generation can significantly reduce build time. See also [Gatsby 5 Umbrella Discussion](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/36609) and the video [Gatsby v5 Alpha Showcase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-WrnfUm33k): partial hydration is coming!

**Extras**:

- 🧑‍🎓Beta docs: [useCallback](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1570021510659579904) + [useMemo](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1568602727147520000)
- 💬 [useEvent update](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/220#issuecomment-1259938816): the `useEvent` prototype is implemented and available via `@experimental`. Some concerns will lead to the opening of a new RFC. If I understand correctly it is possible that this hook will never be released but another solution will be adopted.
