Hi everyone!

This week has been busier than last. In particular, there have been 2 great releases, one of them I was [eagerly waiting for](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/status/1671433559280607235) to hit publish!

- Panda CSS: a very promising CSS-in-JS library
- React-Native 0.72: great improvements, particularly those related to Metro

## ⚛️ React {#react}

[![Panda CSS](/emails/issues/149/panda.jpg)](https://panda-css.com/)

**[Panda CSS](https://panda-css.com/)**

Segun Adebayo (creator of Chakra UI) unveils his long-awaited CSS-in-JS library ([trailer](https://twitter.com/thesegunadebayo/status/1669732623994834946)). It offers very great DX, is based on modern CSS features (cascade layers), is performant (static analysis at build time, no runtime, atomic CSS)... In short, it ticks a lot of boxes and is generating a lot of interest. It integrates particularly well with React (JSX style props, React Server Components compatible, etc.), but can also be used with other frameworks.

This is a library to keep a close eye on and one that could well compete with Tailwind: it integrates better with the target frameworks and doesn't force you to use a lengthy `className`.

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

[![RN 0.72](/emails/issues/149/rn.jpg)](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2023/06/21/0.72-metro-package-exports-symlinks)

**[React Native 0.72 - Symlink Support, Better Errors, and more](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2023/06/21/0.72-metro-package-exports-symlinks)**

After several Golden RCs, the latest version of React-Native has finally been released and will shortly be used in the Expo 49 SDK. There are quite a few improvements mentioned (DX, Hermes, performance...) and some breaking changes. I particularly like these 2 new features in the Metro bundler:

- Symlinks (beta): long-awaited feature to simplify monorepo and pnpm support
- [Package Exports](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2023/06/21/package-exports-support) (beta): better encapsulation of libs, compatibility with the rest of the frontend ecosystem and ability to expose a specific React-Native entry point.
