[![React Router 7.3 - Route Middleware](/emails/issues/225/rr.jpg)](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v730)

**[React Router 7.3 \- Route Middleware](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v730)**

This React Router release introduces a major new middleware feature. It’s not production-ready yet but you can turn it on with the `future.unstable_middleware` future flag. You can use it in framework or library mode. There’s a distinction between client and server middleware. You can use it to implement logging, authentication, and other cross-cutting concerns.

I made a demo to see it in action combined with the upcoming ViewTransition component.
