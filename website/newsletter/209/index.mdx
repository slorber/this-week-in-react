Hi everyone!

This week has been calm on the React side, I couldn't really pick any headline despite various interesting releases and articles.

Once again, the React Native ecosystem is on fire, with Expo 52, but not only!

Last chance to answer the [State of React 2024](https://survey.devographics.com/en-US/survey/state-of-react/2024?source=this_week_in_react) survey that is closing soon. But don't worry, I'll now annoy you with another one that just opened 😃: [State of JS 2024](https://survey.devographics.com/en-US/survey/state-of-js/2024?source=this_week_in_react).

We'd be super grateful if you'd share this newsletter or support us here :

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

[![Expo 52](/emails/issues/209/expo52.jpg)](https://expo.dev/changelog/2024/11-12-sdk-52)

[**Expo SDK 52**](https://expo.dev/changelog/2024/11-12-sdk-52)

Just after the excellent React Native 0.76 milestone release, here comes Expo SDK 52, just as great. There’s a huge changelog and many expo package updates. My favorite items are:

- New Architecture enabled by default for new projects, opt-in for existing ones. Expo Go now only supports the New Architecture.
- Expo Router 4, React Navigation 7
- Universal Server Components and Server Actions (experimental)
- DOM Components with the `’use dom’` directive for incremental migrations or seamlessly integrating a WebView
- React Native DevTools
- Universal Tree Shaking (experimental)
- React Compiler (experimental)
