Hi everyone!

As expected, it's been a quiet week, with developers taking a break for Easter.

Although we don't have a lot of major releases, we still have a good amount of content and blog posts. I really liked the headline blog post. Only Bun decided to release an outstanding v1.1 release on 1st April, quite a bold move!

Apart that, stay safe and make sure to check if you are [affected by xz](https://socket.dev/blog/how-to-use-socket-to-find-out-if-you-were-affected-by-the-backdoored-xz-package), a major security vulnerability unveiled recently.

[**Global progress in Next.js**](https://buildui.com/posts/global-progress-in-nextjs)

Don’t be misled by the title, this great article is a great illustration of how React transitions work. Easy-to-understand Interactive demos show how setState calls inside a transition can be executed synchronously in a click handler, and yet their application to the DOM will be delayed until the transition can fully complete. Also explains why App Router doesn’t expose a router event system anymore. The animation code is also interesting, based on Framer Motion.

[![Refine - Open source Retool Alternative](/emails/issues/177/refine.jpg)](https://github.com/refinedev/refine)

**[Refine - Open source Retool Alternative](https://github.com/refinedev/refine)**

The sweet spot between the low code and traditional development for CRUD-heavy applications.

As an open-source React meta-framework designed for Enterprise applications, [Refine](https://github.com/refinedev/refine) offers a headless solution ideal for tasks like admin panels, dashboards, and internal tools.

While low-code tools may offer initial promise, they often fall short in handling complex scenarios due to scalability issues, limited customization options, and the risk of vendor lock-in.

Refine enables teams to rapidly develop production-ready apps while maintaining flexibility.

[!["New Architecture support in popular libraries"](/emails/issues/180/rn.jpg)](https://github.com/reactwg/react-native-new-architecture/discussions/167)

[**"New Architecture support in popular libraries"**](https://github.com/reactwg/react-native-new-architecture/discussions/167)

This week's headline news is … a spreadsheet? Yes, indeed. We’re approaching the release of React Native 0.74, which will have the Interop Layer and Bridgeless Mode enabled by default. And although you can still turn it off, the message is clear: It’s time to start adopting the New Architecture. There has been a lot of effort to prepare the RN ecosystem for the New Arch, and now there’s a great spreadsheet tracking New Architecture and Bridgeless Mode support for many popular RN libraries. As you can see in the screenshot above, there’s lots of green already, although plenty of rows require some more work as well. In my opinion, even beyond the pure question of which libraries already support the new paradigms this list is also very interesting if you only want to check out which RN libraries are the most popular ones or which technical challenges library authors face when shifting to the New Arch.
