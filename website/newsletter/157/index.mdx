Hi everyone!

It's been pretty quiet on the React front this week, but we've still got a few nice articles to read.

On the React-Native side, Marc Rousavy is on fire, publishing a number of packages that seem to herald the imminent arrival of VisionCamera v3.

We should have some nice releases soon, like [🐦 Bun 1.0](https://twitter.com/jarredsumner/status/1693657906917585359), [🐦 Astro 3.0](https://twitter.com/astrodotbuild/status/1693655809711108456) and [🐦 TanStack Router](https://twitter.com/tannerlinsley/status/1691936709498552654).

I'm taking a short break next week, so I'll see you on 6 September 👋

[![The underlying mechanisms of React’s concurrent mode](/emails/issues/157/concurrentmode.jpg)](https://andreigatej.dev/blog/the-underlying-mechanisms-of-reacts-concurrent-mode/)

[**The underlying mechanisms of React’s concurrent mode**](https://andreigatej.dev/blog/the-underlying-mechanisms-of-reacts-concurrent-mode/)

A quite technical but greatly educational article that study the React codebase. Explains well how `startTransition` works and how it differs from the synchronous rendering mode. I learned how React uses the `MessageChannel` API recursively to periodically hand over to the main thread.
