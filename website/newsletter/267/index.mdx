**[Still writing tests manually?](https://www.meticulous.ai?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=26q1&utm_content=2nd)**

Notion, Dropbox and LaunchDarkly have found a new testing paradigm - and they can't imagine working without it. Built by [ex-Palantir engineers](https://www.meticulous.ai?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=26q1&utm_content=2nd), Meticulous autonomously creates a continuously evolving suite of E2E UI tests that delivers [near-exhaustive coverage](https://www.meticulous.ai?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=26q1&utm_content=2nd) with *zero developer effort* - impossible to deliver by any other means. 

It works like magic in the background:

*   Near-exhaustive coverage on every test run
*   No test creation
*   **No maintenance (seriously)**
*   Zero flakes (built on a deterministic browser)

**🤨** Curious? [Book in a time to learn more](https://www.meticulous.ai?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=26q1&utm_content=2nd)
