**[Still writing tests manually?](https://www.meticulous.ai?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=26q1&utm_content=2nd)**

Notion, Dropbox and LaunchDarkly have found a new testing paradigm - and they can't imagine working without it. Built by [ex-Palantir engineers](https://www.meticulous.ai?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=26q1&utm_content=2nd), Meticulous autonomously creates a continuously evolving suite of E2E UI tests that delivers [near-exhaustive coverage](https://www.meticulous.ai?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=26q1&utm_content=2nd) with _zero developer effort_ - impossible to deliver by any other means. 

It works like magic in the background:

- Near-exhaustive coverage on every test run
- No test creation
- **No maintenance (seriously)**
- Zero flakes (built on a deterministic browser)

**🤨** Curious? [Book in a time to learn more](https://www.meticulous.ai?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=26q1&utm_content=2nd)

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

[![Behind the Scenes of React Native Multithreading: Vision Camera V5 x React Native Worklets](/emails/issues/267/worklets.jpg)](https://blog.swmansion.com/behind-the-scenes-of-react-native-multithreading-vision-camera-v5-x-react-native-worklets-a102c37b32ae)

**[Behind the Scenes of React Native Multithreading: Vision Camera V5 x React Native Worklets](https://blog.swmansion.com/behind-the-scenes-of-react-native-multithreading-vision-camera-v5-x-react-native-worklets-a102c37b32ae)**

Worklets have been extracted from Reanimated to become a first-class multithreading primitive. It has been integrated into the upcoming VisionCamera V5, enabling its real-time frame processor system to run directly on the Camera Thread.

Also, take a look at 📦 [Worklets 0.8 \- Bundle Mode preview](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated/releases/tag/worklets-0.8.0-bundle-mode-preview-1). It makes it possible to use third-party libraries and do network requests within worklets. This mode is opt-in but might become the default in the future.
