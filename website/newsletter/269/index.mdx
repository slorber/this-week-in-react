It root causes errors, suggests fixes, and catches bugs in code review before they hit production.

This free 4-part workshop series covers the full workflow: production error triage, root cause analysis, AI code review, and debugging via MCP. Each session goes hands-on with a specific feature so you can actually set it up and use it in your own projects. No fluff, just walkthroughs you can follow along with.
