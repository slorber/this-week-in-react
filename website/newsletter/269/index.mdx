Hi everyone!

Huge thanks ❤️ — we just hit [\#1 resource](https://2025.stateofreact.com/en-US/resources/#blogs_news_magazines) on the State of React 2025 survey. Wild.

This week leans heavily into TanStack and Next.js content, plus a few notable releases worth your time.

On mobile, Hermes is clearly ramping up, and ByteDance just lowered the barrier to building Lynx apps.

Let’s dive in.

[State of React 2025 \- Survey Results](https://2025.stateofreact.com/)

The State of React 2025 survey results are out. It’s impossible to summarize it all here, but here's what I've taken away:

- `useEffect` remains the most disliked hook
- `<Suspense>` increased in both adoption and satisfaction
- React Server Components and Server Functions divide
- Although usage is still low, `<Activity>` reaches a 100% satisfaction score
- TanStack Query and Zustand remain the favorite third-party libraries
- Your favorite resources are the official docs, this newsletter (❤️), Syntax.fm, Theo and Josh Comeau.

Read also the [breakdown from Aurora Scharff](https://certificates.dev/blog/breaking-down-state-of-react-2025-results), who wrote the survey conclusion.

They implemented a much faster spec-compliant alternative, until upstream performance improvements land in Node.js. No doubt Next.js is going to benefit from all this soon.

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

[WebAssembly Comes to Hermes](https://x.com/tmikov/status/2023821160241393839)

An exciting early preview of WebAssembly support in Hermes, unlocking new ways to integrate C, C++, Rust, and more into your React Native app. It’s even possible to precompile WASM to Hermes bytecode `.hbc` files.

[Sparkling \- Unlocks Lynx at TikTok Scale](https://tiktok.github.io/sparkling/) \- ByteDance unveiled Lynx last year as an interesting framework-agnostic alternative to React Native. So far, the DX has been limited, and there has been no easy way to build a new Lynx app from scratch. Sparkling changes that, and offers the tooling that Lynx apps deserve. By the way, [Lynx 3.6](https://lynxjs.org/blog/lynx-3-6) is out, improving support for React, AI, and CSS.
