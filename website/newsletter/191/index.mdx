**[The Category-Defining React Grid for Your Enterprise](https://1771technologies.com/graphitegrid)**

Data grids are complex components of web applications, but current solutions are inefficient, require a lot of maintenance, and perform poorly. [Graphite Grid](https://1771technologies.com/graphitegrid) transforms the landscape with two key features: retargetable rendering and reactive signal state.

**Graphite Grid** separates grid state from view logic, allowing a single unified state model to support a variety of render targets, declaratively or imperatively. It includes a **DOM and Canvas** renderer, giving developers flexible, high-performance options 🚀.

Graphite Grid is declarative and consistent, leveraging state signals to ensure seamless integration with your application. Designed with **React in mind**, it is the only JavaScript data grid built with React's state management primitives. [Try it now!](https://1771technologies.com/graphitegrid/demo)
