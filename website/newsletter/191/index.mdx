Hi everyone!

This week it looks like we are finally entering the summer/holiday season and the pace of major React announcements is slowing down. We will also be taking a short summer break, skip 2 issues, and be back on July 17.

On the React side, we continue to have interesting content related to the Suspense drama from last week. A new React Router feature permits you to code split your route tree.

On the React Native side, it looks like the team is trying to release v0.75 as RC, and encountering some roadblocks, but it’ll probably be out soon.

The most exciting news to me is the TypeScript 5.5 stable release: it’s a great one, notably for predicate type inference! The State of JS survey results are also out if you want to explore JS trends.

**[The Category-Defining React Grid for Your Enterprise](https://1771technologies.com/graphitegrid)**

Data grids are complex components of web applications, but current solutions are inefficient, require a lot of maintenance, and perform poorly. [Graphite Grid](https://1771technologies.com/graphitegrid) transforms the landscape with two key features: retargetable rendering and reactive signal state.

**Graphite Grid** separates grid state from view logic, allowing a single unified state model to support a variety of render targets, declaratively or imperatively. It includes a **DOM and Canvas** renderer, giving developers flexible, high-performance options 🚀.

Graphite Grid is declarative and consistent, leveraging state signals to ensure seamless integration with your application. Designed with **React in mind**, it is the only JavaScript data grid built with React's state management primitives. [Try it now!](https://1771technologies.com/graphitegrid/demo)

[![React-Router 6.24 - Lazy Route Discovery](/emails/issues/191/rr.jpg)](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v6240)

**📦 [React-Router 6.24 - Lazy Route Discovery](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v6240)**

This React Router release includes a new `unstable_patchRoutesOnMiss` hook that will be called when React Router can’t match any existing route. It permits you to load additional routes and implement code splitting for your routes instead of keeping them all in a single monolithic module. A welcome feature for large apps with thousands of routes, that now don’t need to load all of them upfront, delaying hydration.

Remix was supposed to take a nap, but apparently not yet! 📦 [Remix 2.10](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/start/changelog#v2100) is out and already leverages that new React Router feature by exposing it through a convenient [“Fog of War”](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/fog-of-war) feature that you can enable with a simple `future.unstable_fogOfWar` flag. An early discovery optimization has also been implemented to avoid waterfalls.
