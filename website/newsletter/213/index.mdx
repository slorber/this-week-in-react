**[React 19](https://react.dev/blog/2024/12/05/react-19)**

React 19 RCs' has been one of the main characters of this newsletter for the past year, so there’s not much more to say apart that it's officially stable, apart 2 new features: the pre-warming feature that delayed the release, and new React-DOM static APIs. Here's a good reminder of other features we already covered;

- Actions / Server Actions / `useActionState()`
- `<form>` \+ progressive enhancement compatible hooks
- `<Context>` instead of `<Context.Provider>`
- The `use()` hook
- Custom Elements
- Ref as standard props and ref callbacks cleanup functions
- Meta tags handling
- Resource preloading
- Better errors and hydration diff reporting
