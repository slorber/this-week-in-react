Hi everyone!

This week, I've been looking at the release of Lit 3.0 to see if the use of Web Components has become easier with React.

On the React-Native side, version 0.73 is in release candidate with a number of DX improvements. There's also interesting activity regarding the possible optimisation of the Text and View components. Canvaskit-js makes it possible to run Skia on the web for just 20kb!

There were some interesting announcements at ViteConf last week. Notably a Rust port of Rollup, and the usage of Vite with Remix and React-Native.

## ⚛️ React {#react}

[![Lit React v1.0](/emails/issues/162/lit.jpg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit/react)

[**Lit React v1.0**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit/react)

Google's Web Components framework [Lit has just been released in v3.0](https://lit.dev/blog/2023-10-10-lit-3.0/). In addition to improvements to the framework (decorators, template compiler, Preact Signals), there is in particular the `@lit/react` integration package, which has graduated from the Lab, is now stable and in v1.0.

This integration facilitates the use of Web Components in a React app (or Preact) by creating a wrapper that maps React props to the properties of the custom element, manages event handlers and facilitates TypeScript typing. It fills certain gaps in React 18, which does not integrate easily with Web Components: props are mapped to attributes rather than properties. See the [documentation for the React framework](https://lit.dev/docs/frameworks/react/).

But can a modern React dev use all this easily? Lit offers experimental packages [@lit-labs/ssr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit-labs/ssr), [@lit-labs/ssr-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit-labs/ssr-react) and [@lit-labs/nextjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit-labs/nextjs) but support is limited and won't work with Next.js App Router. The [Declarative Shadow DOM](https://developer.chrome.com/articles/declarative-shadow-dom/), which allows SSR, is not yet implemented in Firefox, but a polyfill exists. In short, Lit should work well on a CRA app, but still feels a bit risky if you need SSR and SEO.

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

[![Using RCTView & RCTText in React Native for Performance Gains](/emails/issues/162/rnperf.jpg)](https://blog.theodo.com/2023/10/native-views-rn-performance/)

[**Using RCTView & RCTText in React Native for Performance Gains**](https://blog.theodo.com/2023/10/native-views-rn-performance/)

At the moment, React-Native devs are talking a lot [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/FernandoTheRojo/status/1707762822015267219) about the perf of the `Text` and `View` components, which are JS wrappers and add overhead compared to the respective native `RCTText` and `RCTView` elements. William Candillon had already 🎥 [explained this problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D78Tc46Xqo&t=1156s) in 2021, with the possibility of optimising Text rendering. It is possible to optimize as long as you don't need a few features like `onPress` listeners. This article presents a benchmark and measures the impact of using the native components instead of regular components, and reports a gain of around 15%, with variations depending on the platform and architecture.

Now that this trick became mainstream, React-Native devs are keen to take advantage of it. We can note the creation of [react-native-fast-text](https://github.com/peterpme/react-native-fast-text), or the POC of a Babel plugin [react-native-optimizer](https://github.com/marklawlor/react-native-optimizer) which would apply this optimisation automatically.
