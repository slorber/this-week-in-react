**[Bit: Celebrating 10 Years of Composability](https://bit.cloud/?utm_source=ThisWeekInReact&utm_id=551)**

For a decade, we navigated the complexities of disconnected systems, facing integration headaches and scaling challenges. Our journey to build effectively at scale led us to a breakthrough: [**Harmony**](https://bit.dev/blog/meet-harmony-a-practical-solution-for-composability/).  
  
Discover our 10-year story of pioneering composable architecture and how Harmony finally delivered the monolithic simplicity and distributed power we always envisioned, transforming our development from struggle to exponential progress.

**[Ship dashboards in minutes — not sprints](https://semaphor.cloud)**

Sempahor is a React based SDK to launch fully-interactive dashboards in your customer-facing products.

Semaphor helps you decouple analytics from your product code, so you can iterate quickly, and ship new insights independently — without needing to redeploy your app.

The CPO of TalentsConnect sums it up best:

"Semaphor has transformed our product and data team's workflow. They can now more quickly prototype and test new use cases directly in our application with our clients, significantly reducing feedback cycle time. Plus, Semaphor's styling options are outstanding, fitting seamlessly with our product's design"
