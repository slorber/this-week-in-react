Hey everyone!

Cyril and Matthieu here from [Theodo Apps](https://apps.theodo.com/) 👋 with your weekly dose of React and React Native updates, while Seb is busy enjoying the [React Native Connection](https://reactnativeconnection.io/) conf!

React 19.1 just dropped with better error handling and deeper integration for Server Components in Parcel. Meanwhile, Tailwind CSS 4.1 is right around the corner, and the community is buzzing with hot takes on CSS-in-JS. On the React Native side, the golden RC for 0.79 is out, and ExecuTorch v0.4.0 is landing soon with exciting AI features.

Let’s get into it! 🚀

**[Bit: Celebrating 10 Years of Composability](https://bit.cloud/?utm_source=ThisWeekInReact&utm_id=551)**

For a decade, we navigated the complexities of disconnected systems, facing integration headaches and scaling challenges. Our journey to build effectively at scale led us to a breakthrough: [**Harmony**](https://bit.dev/blog/meet-harmony-a-practical-solution-for-composability/).

Discover our 10-year story of pioneering composable architecture and how Harmony finally delivered the monolithic simplicity and distributed power we always envisioned, transforming our development from struggle to exponential progress.

## ⚛️ React {#react}

[![React 19.1](/emails/issues/228/react_19_1.jpg)](https://github.com/facebook/react/releases/tag/v19.1.0)

**[React 19.1](https://github.com/facebook/react/releases/tag/v19.1.0)**

React 19.1 has been released this week, the most notable changes are:

- A new [`captureOwnerStack()`](https://react.dev/reference/react/captureOwnerStack) API that will be used by frameworks to provide better error information in dev. It’s different from the existing component stacks in how it handles `children` and DOM nodes.
- The “React side” of Server Components support in Parcel, that works hand-in-hand with the new features in Parcel 2.14.
- An experimental `unstable_prerender()` for prerendering React Server Components on the server.

This release also includes a slew of minor changes and fixes, most of them related to Server Components or `Suspense` boundaries.

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

It’s been a quiet week in the React Native community—perhaps because all eyes are on the React Native Connection happening right now in Paris. Hopefully, we’ll have plenty of exciting topics to dive into next week 🤗

- 💸 [Radon IDE – All-in-one tool for React Native & Expo development. Now with Network Inspector and Outline Renders!](https://ide.swmansion.com/?utm_source=thisweekinreact.com)
- 🐦 [Nice animated SplashScreen using Expo SplashScreen and RN Masked View.](https://x.com/S0LARIN/status/1905829104600875025)
- 🐦 [React Native ExecuTorch 0.4 is announced for end of May](https://x.com/swmansion/status/1907086132828934414): with Universal LLM Runner, Additional LLMs support, Embedding models, Multilingual Whisper, OCR, Image segmentation…
- 👀 [React Native 0.79 Golden RC](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases/tag/v0.79.0-rc.4): We should have a stable release next week.
- 👀 [Lynx is exploring solutions for native plugin development](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx/discussions/1#discussioncomment-12660488)
- 🗓️ [App.js Conf](https://appjs.co/?utm_source=thisweekinreact) - 🇵🇱 Kraków - 28-30 May. We're thrilled to announce the first speakers for App.js Conf 2025: Charlie Cheever, Enzo Manuel Mangano & Delphine Bugner! Grab your ticket now with a 15% discount using the code "TWIR".
- 📜 [SDK 52 patches for Xcode 16.3](https://expo.dev/changelog/xcode-16-3-patches): If you encountered build issues when upgrading to Xcode 16.3, you may have to install the latest SDK 52 patch and RN0.77. Or move back to Xcode 16.2 🫠
- 📜 [React Native: 10 years](https://shift.infinite.red/react-native-10-years-db9eb36c5af6): Infinite Red celebrates the birthday.
- 📦 [React Native Screens 4.10](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens/releases/tag/4.10.0): iOS min supported version bumped to v15.1, experimental support for scrollview header when using formsheet, many android bug fixes.
- 📦 [Unistyles 3.0 RC.1](https://github.com/jpudysz/react-native-unistyles/releases/tag/v3.0.0-rc.1): This has just been announced at React Native Connection conference, the library entered RC. Apart from the nice styling features, this version is quite exciting because it handles many things on the "Shadow Tree" of React Native using C++, allowing you to implement dynamic styles that do not need React to re-render components on the JS side when dependencies such as theme, signal, screen size/orientation and other dependencies change. This reminds how CSS works on the web: we don't need a React re-render when we cross a breakpoint.
- 📦 [React Native MacOS 0.78](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos/releases/tag/v0.78.0): The library caught up. We also heard it now supports Skia and WebGPU.

- 🎥 [Theo \- Android just changed forever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucZx1ArrIVQ)
