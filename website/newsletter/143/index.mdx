Hi everyone!

We have a lot of great React articles this week, but also some nice releases. I liked the breakdown of the animations on the new Next.js website, and the discovery of the new Panda CSS library.

We feel that React is becoming more and more a framework with the Server Components. A new experimental hook `useFormStatus` is coming 👀.

Callstack offers us a nice resource on Super Apps in React-Native.

There was a big wave of layoffs at Meta 😓.

FYI this newsletter has a **[Discord chat](https://thisweekinreact.com/chat)**. It used to be French-only, but I reorganized it to welcome all of you now, so please join us and let's have a chat!

**[Crafting the Next.js Website](https://rauno.me/craft/nextjs)**

You may have noticed the [new Nextjs.org landing page](https://nextjs.org/)? Rauno works at Vercel and deconstructs the UI subtleties of this page. Personally I love their gradient tracing technique! Interesting React implementation and great result.

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

[![Super App Development](/emails/issues/143/superapp.jpg)](https://www.callstack.com/super-app-development)

**[Super App Development](https://www.callstack.com/super-app-development)**

Callstack published a great resource on Super Apps, which allow to assemble several mini apps under a single mobile interface. They describe the business and organizational benefits as well as the possible technical solutions, and highlight their preferred solution: Re.Pack and Module Federation. There is also a repo [Super App Showcase](https://github.com/callstack/super-app-showcase) with an example Super App to study.

Super Apps are popular in Asia (WeChat, MoMo...) but are gaining momentum. My intuition tells me that the [PlayStation 5 UI could be a React-Native Super App](https://twitter.com/syke/status/1619413099861413889), to be confirmed!
