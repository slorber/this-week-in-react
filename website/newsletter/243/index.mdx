[![Node-API Support for React Native](/emails/issues/243/nodeapi.jpg)](https://www.callstack.com/blog/announcing-node-api-support-for-react-native)

[**Node-API Support for React Native**](https://www.callstack.com/blog/announcing-node-api-support-for-react-native)

A collaborative effort to bring Node-API into React Native. Node-API allows native code to interface with JavaScript in a runtime-independent and ABI-stable way. The PR adding Node-API support to Hermes is a work-in-progress, although most of the actual code is being upstreamed from React Native Windows.

[**Introducing react-native-wallet**](https://blog.swmansion.com/introducing-react-native-wallet-90c1ee103d3e)

A new React Native library created by Expensify and Software Mansion.

It supports a wide array of card providers like Visa, MasterCard, Amex, or Discover, and ensures the integration follows the strict guidelines and best practices required by both Google and Apple.
