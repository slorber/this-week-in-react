Hi everyone! **Tomek and Tymek from [Software Mansion](https://swmansion.com/?utm_source=thisweekinreact)** here! 👋

This week, we're coming with some interesting announcements and even more noteworthy news. Next.js 15.4 has been announced, bringing Turbopack support and stability improvements.

On the React Native side, 0.81 is getting closer and closer to us as the new release candidate shows and there’s a couple of new announcements around react-native-worklets, react-native-wallet and Module Federation Metro and Node API support for React Native.

I hope you are already excited, because there is much more interesting news to come.

Let's get into it!
