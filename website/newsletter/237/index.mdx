- Test widget: Click to run a comprehensive test suite

This release also includes:

- 48% Leaner: Smaller install with optional docs and test packages
- Story generation: Tools to write stories automatically
- Tag-based organization: Filter and group stories by tag

- 📜 [Progressive JSON](https://overreacted.io/progressive-json/): Dan uses various analogies to illustrate the difference between different data streaming strategies. The depth-first strategy \- used by JPEG, JSON and HTML \- streams the data in order and either delay the parsing or creates an arbitrary cutoff point. The breadth-first strategy streams data out-of-order, replacing nested data with placeholders that can be filled later. React Server Components use the breadth-first strategy. Suspense allows to intentionally reveal the UI, decoupled from data reception. A quite interesting post that also exists in [video format](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaMQLNBZz64).
- 📜 [One Roundtrip Per Navigation](https://overreacted.io/one-roundtrip-per-navigation/): Dan gives a comprehensive overview of the tradeoffs of the main React data fetching patterns. Using Server Components is quite similar to composing many Server Loaders into a single one, giving you the performance and co-location benefits of Relay while using vanilla JS code.
- 📜 [RSC for LISP Developers](https://overreacted.io/rsc-for-lisp-developers/): The `’use client’` directive is similar to LISP quoting, marking a piece of code as data to be evaluated later.
- 📜 [Why Does RSC Integrate with a Bundler?](https://overreacted.io/why-does-rsc-integrate-with-a-bundler/): Server Components need a way to serialize component modules from the server to the client. It’s technically possible to do so without a bundler, but it’s inefficient.
- 📜 [Search Params Are State](https://tanstack.com/blog/search-params-are-state): Tanner gives good reason for TanStack Router to associate a search params schema with route definitions. This helps improve type-safety, optimizes re-renders, and prevents schema fragmentation.
- 📜 [The Power in Pragmatism](https://tanstack.com/blog/power-in-pragmatism): Libraries from the TanStack ecosystem aren’t tied to any rendering framework, but focus on the core ideas.TanStack Start is a flexible framework that adapts to your needs instead of anticipating them.
- 📜 [useSyncExternalStore: Demystified for Practical React Development](https://www.epicreact.dev/use-sync-external-store-demystified-for-practical-react-development-w5ac0): A good overview of one of my favorite hooks, including common mistakes.
- 📜 [Directive prologues and JavaScript dark matter](https://macwright.com/2025/04/29/directive-prologues-and-javascript-dark-matter): Gives interesting context on various ways to control how JS is interpreted: JSX pragmas, directives, and magic comments.

- 📦 [Lingo Compiler](https://lingo.dev/en/compiler): A free open-source compiler to automatically translate any React app at build time without touching the source code. It processes the React code AST and translates it automatically with LLMs, and even supports hot module replacement. A great innovation with first-class integrations for Next.js, React Router, Remix, and Vite apps. The [demo on X](https://x.com/MaxPrilutskiy/status/1929946504216932746) is impressive.
- 📦 [LiveStore Beta](https://livestore.dev/): The creator of Prisma introduced a new client-centric state management solution with first-class support for React and Expo. Based on SQLite, event sourcing, and reactivity, it can also sync clients through various providers. The landing page is quite cool to check and explains how it all works.
- 📦 [Base UI 1.0 Beta](https://github.com/mui/base-ui/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.0): The upcoming Radix UI contender is now in beta. This release includes new Menubar, NavigationMenu, and ContextMenu components.
