Hi everyone!

This week is relatively calm in the React ecosystem, but we still have various interesting blog posts and releases. Maybe we'll soon get some exciting news from [React Summit](https://reactsummit.com/) that's about on Friday!

On the React Native side, all the devs are already working on iOS 26 Liquid Glass support and other things announced by Apple yesterday. This new design thing is rather controversial and subject to a lot of mockery 😂. React Native 0.80 is just around the corner, I'll keep all this for later, but you can get a sneak peek in [Alex Hunt talk at App.js](https://www.youtube.com/live/UTaJlqhTk2g?t=6520s).

The JS ecosystem has been rather active with Oxlint 1.0 and various interesting Node.js news.

**[What engineers get wrong about communication](https://go.posthog.com/twir-jun11)**

Engineers spend most of their time doing two things: coding and communicating. The first has endless amounts written about it; the second much less so.

To address this injustice, [PostHog](https://go.posthog.com/twir-jun11-ph) shares the biggest mistakes they see engineers make when communicating and what they do as a remote, async, engineering-led company to eliminate them.

[Read it here](https://go.posthog.com/twir-jun11).

## ⚛️ React {#react}

- 💸 [Build professional design system in less than a day, using Hope AI, new model by Bit.Cloud.](https://bit.cloud/solutions/design-systems?utm_source=ThisWeekInReact&campaign=DesignSystem)
- 🦋 [React Conf \- First speakers announced](https://bsky.app/profile/react.dev/post/3lqxleaezcs2p): I guess we’ll have React Compiler news in October.
- 📣 [React Router Open Governance](https://remix.run/blog/rr-governance): React Router gets more community-driven, forming a Steering Committee initially composed of Remix team members. RFCs will follow stages inspired by the TC39 process. This also gives a sneak peek of what you can expect in v8. See also [video comments from Alem Tuzlak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qh2TRkNnyVw).
- 📜 [How Imports Work in RSC](https://overreacted.io/how-imports-work-in-rsc/): Dan Abramov deep dives on module systems. The JS one creates singletons and is quite different from the C one, which creates duplication by default. RSCs permit creating a single program spanning across two computers, with two independent module systems. By the way, you can now have a [1:1 consulting call with Dan](https://overreacted.io/im-doing-a-little-consulting/).
- 📜 [Reactivity is easy](https://romgrk.com/posts/reactivity-is-easy/): Nice interactive article showing how to let cells of a data grid read from React context without useless re-renders.
- 📜 [useState should require a dependency array](https://bikeshedd.ing/posts/use_state_should_require_a_dependency_array/): Interesting interactive article advocating for `useState(initialState, deps)` with good arguments. I’m not sure I agree, though: using a `key` and splitting your UI into smaller components is probably enough, but curious to see what others think about this idea.
- 📜 [Beware The URL Type-Safety Iceberg](https://nuqs.47ng.com/blog/beware-the-url-type-safety-iceberg): The author of the `nuqs` library warns of the hidden dangers of search parameters. You’d rather design beautiful URLs, stay within size limits, deal with URL update rate limits, validate params, and be able to migrate old URLs to a new validation schema.
- 📜 [Use Async Local Storage to prevent props drilling in Next.js Route handlers](https://www.nico.fyi/blog/async-local-storage-to-prevent-props-drilling): It's like React Context but for Node.js functions.
- 📜 [How to Integrate Plausible Analytics in a Next.js App](https://mxd.codes/articles/how-to-integrate-plausible-analytics-in-a-next-js-app-without-getting-blocked): Proxying analytics API calls makes them less likely to trigger ad-blocking extensions.

- 📦 [TanStack Router 1.121](https://github.com/TanStack/router/discussions/2863#discussioncomment-13104960): Important milestone introducing a new `@tanstack/react-start` package. TanStack Start is now just a Vite plugin.
- 📦 [shadcn/ui \- June 2025 updates](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/changelog): Upgrades `Calendar` to the latest `react-day-picker`, introduces a new CLI command to migrate imports to the new unified `radix-ui` package.
- 📦 [ForesightJS 2.0 \- Predict user intent to prefetch](https://foresightjs.com/): This library predicts mouse cursor and keyboard navigation to prefetch data earlier than mouse hover. Docs show how to integrate it with React Router and Next.js link components. TanStack will soon have a similar feature built in ([tweet](https://x.com/tannerlinsley/status/1908723776650355111)). This might also be useful in the future for pre-rendering with React `<Activity>`.
