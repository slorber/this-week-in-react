Stream is the maker of enterprise-grade **APIs** and **SDKs** that help product and engineering teams solve two common problems at scale: in-app chat and social activity feeds.

With Stream, developers can integrate any type of messaging or feed experience into their app in a fraction of the time it would take to build these features from scratch. Stream Chat makes it easy for developers to integrate rich, real-time messaging into their applications.

Stream provides robust client-side SDKs for popular frameworks such as [**React**](https://getstream.io/chat/sdk/react/?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=sponsorship&utm_content=&utm_campaign=thisweekinreact_July2023_video_klmh22), [**React-Native**](https://getstream.io/chat/sdk/react-native/?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=sponsorship&utm_content=&utm_campaign=thisweekinreact_July2023_video_klmh22), Expo, Flutter, Android, Angular, Compose, Unreal, and iOS.

**[A Non-Cloud Alternative to Google Forms that has it all](https://surveyjs.io/?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=email)**

If you are looking to set up **a robust form management system fully integrated in your IT infrastructure** that allows you to **retain full control over the data flow**, and you don’t want to spend months and thousands of dollars to get it up and running, then SurveyJS is the way to go!

SurveyJS is a product suite of four open-source JavaScript libraries that allow you to **create and edit** multiple dynamic **JSON-based forms** in a drag-and-drop form builder, render them in your React app and **store sensitive survey data within your in-house infrastructure**. You can then **render your custom surveys and forms as editable PDF files** in a browser and visualize survey results with **interactive charts and tables**. [Learn more now](https://surveyjs.io/?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=email).
