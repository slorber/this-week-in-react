Hi everyone!

Cyril and Matthieu from Theodo Apps (formerly BAM) here 👋, standing in for Seb to bring you the latest news from React and React Native!

Big news from the React world this week! React 19 is back in RC, six months after its initial release was postponed. The suspense over Suspense is finally easing with the introduction of pre-warming.

Expo is making waves during its launch party, and the excitement keeps building! 🚀

The newly announced **Expo Workflows** promises to revolutionize CI/CD for React Native apps with pre-packaged jobs, intelligent machine selection, and seamless automation — streamlining the entire release process.

Meanwhile, **Universal React Server Components** in Expo Router have entered beta, marking a major milestone in the journey toward **server-first React Native development**.

And the party isn’t over yet! 🎉 Stay tuned for next week’s issue, where we’ll dive into even more announcements from Expo’s ongoing celebration.

[**React 19 RC1 - Siblings pre-warming**](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/29898#issuecomment-2477449973)

We’ve covered how the initial release of React 19 was aborted because of a change in Suspense that would have caused waterfalls in apps that use Suspense without starting fetches in event handlers.  
The React team has been hard at work to reintroduce Suspense sibling prerendering without causing performance regressions for apps that start fetching early. Their solution is now ready and it’s called [pre-warming](https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19-upgrade-guide#improvements-to-suspense). Dominik, the React Query maintainer who raised awareness of this problem, [has confirmed he’s happy with the fix](https://bsky.app/profile/tkdodo.eu/post/3layw6wk5bs2b).  
As usual, the new features were already available in Next.JS (which uses react canary). They include server components and actions, the new `use` hook, improvements to forms handling (`useFormStatus` and `useOptimistic`), and a small but long-awaited change: `forwardRef` is not necessary anymore!

[![Expo Workflows](/emails/issues/210/workflows.jpg)](https://expo.dev/blog/expo-workflows-automate-your-release-process)

[**Expo Workflows**](https://expo.dev/blog/expo-workflows-automate-your-release-process)
Expo has announced "Workflows," a new CI/CD tool for React Native and Expo apps that simplifies and accelerates app releases with pre-packaged jobs (such as E2E tests using Maestro), automated workflows, and smart machine selection for optimal performance. While it’s not a direct replacement for more general CI/CD solutions like GitHub Actions, it promises exciting improvements worth exploring.

🎉 [Expo Launch Party](https://expo.dev/launch-party) is still running. Don’t miss their announcements\!

- 📣 [Expo \- Introducing Channel Pausing for EAS Update : Pause your channels either on the web page or via the eas cli](https://expo.dev/changelog/2024/11-14-channel-pausing)
- 📜 [Universal React Server Components in Expo Router (in beta)](https://expo.dev/blog/universal-react-server-components-developer-preview): Expo Router introduces for the first time universal React Server Components, enabling server-side rendering in both native and web apps. Though not production-ready due to unavailable production exports and mainly aimed at library authors, it's an exciting development because it enables direct server-side access to resources like secrets, databases, and file systems, simplifying development and improving performance by eliminating client-server round trips.
- 📜 [The magic of Expo DOM Components](https://expo.dev/blog/the-magic-of-expo-dom-components): Expo DOM Components make it easier to integrate web features into React Native apps, combining the speed of WebViews with incremental native migration. While limited by WebView performance and compatibility with some Expo features, future updates aim to enhance native integration and optimize performance.
