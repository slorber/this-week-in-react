[![Josh Comeau - The Undeniable Utility Of CSS `:has`](/emails/issues/200/css-has.jpg)](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/has/)

**CSS `:has` for React developers**

This week we have 2 great articles about the new CSS `:has` selector, and how React developers can leverage it and simplify/delete their JS code while also improving performances. This new CSS feature had quite good support (92%) but can’t be polyfilled so for now you’d rather use it for subtle things and progressive enhancement.

Read in that order:

- 📜 [Josh Comeau \- The Undeniable Utility Of CSS `:has`](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/has/): Great interactive introduction article, also including some comments and examples relevant for React developers, such as blocking the global page scroll on modal opening with a data attribute instead of an `useEffect`.
- 📜 [Nadia Makarevich \- Replacing React code with CSS `:has` selector](https://www.developerway.com/posts/replacing-react-with-css): Gives a few more interesting React-based examples, such as handling focus, highlighting table rows or form fieldset depending on input state.

With great power comes great responsibility. Remember to keep your React components encapsulated, and avoid styles that leak outside component boundaries whenever possible.

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

Last week, Wrocław was the stage for React Universe, where major announcements thrilled the React Native community. One of the standout moments was the unveiling of React Native 0.76, set to launch by the end of October. This release brings significant advancements, including the New Architecture enabled by default and the introduction of completely revamped React Native DevTools. It’s already available as [a 0.76 release candidate](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases/tag/v0.76.0-rc.0)\!

[![React Native DevTools](/emails/issues/200/react-native-devtools.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b48Lax2-jOQ&t=4350s)

- 🎥 [Alex Hunt - The New React Native Debugger - Codename "Fusebox"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b48Lax2-jOQ&t=4350s)
  Debugging tools for React Native have long been fragmented, but the new "React Native DevTools" introduces a unified experience with a new backend powered by the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP). This architecture, supported by IDEs and Chrome DevTools, promises more reliable breakpoints and stable reloads. It supports both the new and old architectures, positioning itself as the go-to debugging solution for React Native apps. Direct Hermes debugging via Chrome will be phased out, though performance and network inspection features are still in progress.

[![Hermes Performance Chart](/emails/issues/200/hermes-perf.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfeTPSai6vc&t=8702s)

- 🎥 [Tzvetan Mikov - Hermes: Better performance with runtime bytecode translation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfeTPSai6vc&t=8702s)  
  Static Hermes, introduced at React Native Europe last year, has sparked significant interest by challenging existing JavaScript engine standards. While still under development, Static Hermes offers a novel approach by compiling JavaScript into native machine code or typed bytecode through type annotation analysis, with the potential for C++-level performance. However, this workflow has its limitations: over-the-air (OTA) updates will no longer function, current JavaScript build tools like Babel do not retain type annotations, and there is still a considerable amount of untyped code in use. To address these challenges, the Hermes team has introduced runtime bytecode translation, which promises performance boosts of up to 12 times faster for native compilation. These innovations will be available in Hermes v2, once they have undergone extensive internal testing at Meta.
