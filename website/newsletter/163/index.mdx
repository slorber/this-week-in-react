Hi everyone!

There's a lot of content this week! Releases, but also some very good React articles. And there's no end in sight, with some great React conferences coming up: React Advanced, Next.js Conf, reactjsday...

I've also got some great news to share with you in advance: I'm about to become the father of a little girl 🤗

For the 1st time ever, the newsletter will be taking a long break of several weeks, starting now. The next newsletter issue is scheduled for November 29.

Otherwise I'm staying on course to pass 30,000 subscribers by the end of the year. While I'm away, you can keep bringing me new mates 😜

Thank you and see you soon 👋

[![Rspress v1.0 - A fast Rspack-based static site generator](/emails/issues/163/rspress.jpg)](https://github.com/orgs/web-infra-dev/discussions/5)

[**Rspress v1.0 - A fast Rspack-based static site generator**](https://github.com/orgs/web-infra-dev/discussions/5)

First stable release for this new static site generator from the ByteDance team. Based on Rust, React and MDX. A serious contender for Docusaurus, Nextra, Vitepress, Starlight and other content-oriented solutions. Rspress is performant, while offering an impressive list of features: i18n, versioning, search, etc. The competition is getting tough, and that's motivating me even more to add some Rust to Docusaurus 😄!

[![Remix - Vite Support](/emails/issues/163/remix-vite.jpg)](https://remix.run/docs/en/dev/future/vite)

[**Remix - Vite Support (Unstable)**](https://remix.run/docs/en/dev/future/vite)

Remix explains its decision to become a Vite plugin in this [proposal](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/discussions/7632). This enables to open up its compiler and become more flexible by allowing users to add their own Vite plugins, and handle various scenarios: MDX, GraphQL, Tailwind, path aliases, etc.

🎥 [**Statically analysing React components for fun and profit**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjOacmVsLSE)

Sathya is working on React-Forget, the long-awaited compiler. This talk reveals some interesting details:

- Compiling is possible thanks to React's new model, which no longer uses classes or `this`
- It reasons locally, is able to optimise in parallel, and can be adopted incrementally
- It works on untyped JavaScript, and understands React conventions such as hooks and the "use" prefix
- Its alias analysis system is even more complete than that of the V8 engine

Sathya says we should be hearing more about React-Forget in the coming weeks, including in the talk ["Understanding Idiomatic React" at React Advanced](https://reactadvanced.com/schedule-offline) in just 2 days. In short, we can't wait to hear more!

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

[![Gluestack](/emails/issues/163/gluestack.jpg)](https://gluestack.io/ui/v1)

[**Gluestack-ui v1.0 - Universal & Accessible UI Components for React Native & Web, Unstyled & Themed**](https://gluestack.io/ui/v1)

Stable v1.0 release for this new cross-platform styling solution and component library in React-Native. There's already quite a lot included in this first version: VSCode plugin, Figma kit, Expo and Next.js support, headless and styled primitives. We're going to have to take a closer look at all that! I think the RSC support with Next.js is still limited and will require the 'use client' directive.
