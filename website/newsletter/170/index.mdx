Hi everyone!

This week we had some really great React articles, but also interesting releases from Waku and Remix. The community shared mitigated but interesting feedback on React Server Components, regarding complexity and ownership.

On the React Native side, it's calm. We are eagerly waiting for the Expo SDK 50 which this time is released much later than the beta. We are also waiting for the official launch of VisionOS, a new platform that React Native will support.

I just [celebrated 10 years of React experience](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/status/1747307299356447148) 🙉 It's hard to believe how my career changed thanks to React, considering I used to really dislike JavaScript.

[![Waku 0.19](/emails/issues/170/waku.jpg)](https://waku.gg/blog/introducing-create-pages)

**[Waku 0.19](https://waku.gg/blog/introducing-create-pages)**

This release introduces a new `createPage` API for creating layouts and pages programmatically. This notably marks the shift of Waku from being a React Server Components learning experience to becoming a real production-ready React framework. A lightweight file-based page route is expected for v0.20.

**[Delicious Donut Components](https://frontendatscale.com/blog/donut-components/)**

This joyful and awesome interactive article uses the donut analogy (client component with a “children” hole) to explain how client/server components can be interleaved. It also covers more advanced RSC composition topics. Today I learned about that fancy server action render prop trick!

- 🐦 [Dan Abramov - “React Server Components does not require a server”](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov2/status/1745795274977493317): Another important reminder that RSCs can all run at build time too, and the CI is your server. You can deploy a completely static Next.js site using RSCs to S3 or GitHub Pages.

- 📜 [React, where are you going?](https://dev.to/matfrana/react-where-are-you-going-5284): Matteo builds on top of Cassidy’s take and explains his frustration regarding React ownership and increasing complexity. He advocates for a financially sustainable community-driven framework. What struck me is that adding RSC support to their lib React-Bricks decreased the DX (also confirmed by a few others, 🐦 [tweet](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/status/1747643069460021405)).
