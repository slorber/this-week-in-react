**[No-Code Form Builder for React](https://surveyjs.io/?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=email)**

SurveyJS is a product suite of open-source JavaScript libraries that allow you to **build a** **robust form management system** fully integrated into your IT infrastructure.

You can create and easily modify multiple **JSON-based forms in a drag-and-drop form builder with an integrated Theme Editor**. Adjust various UI theme settings to achieve unique form looks. Render custom forms in your React application, collect responses from users, and **maintain full control over the data flow**. These libraries do not directly interact with server code or databases.
