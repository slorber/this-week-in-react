Hi everyone!

It's been a long time, I hope you haven't missed me too much 😄

I've been on paternity leave and enjoyed my little Louise 👨‍🍼😍.

Apparently my absence hasn't slowed down the growth of this newsletter, which has just [passed 30,000 subscribers](https://www.indiehackers.com/product/french-react-newsletter/30-000-subscribers--NkKag3m683I_z7J3TCI)! 🥳️

This is the first time I've taken such a long break (5 weeks), and it's hard to get back at it. You know I like to be exhaustive, but it's impossible for me to read and comment on everything that's happened since the last issue 😅. In short, this email is going to contain a lot of interesting links, but not necessarily commented on. I'll do better next week, I promise!

In the future, I'd like to make this more professional, and publish every single week consistently. I'm [looking for someone to help me](https://thisweekinreact.com/job). If you're interested, please apply (paid).
