**[React-admin: The Open-Source Framework for B2B apps](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/)**

Used by 25,000 companies, React-admin is the leading framework for building ERPs, internal tools, and B2B apps with React. Here are 3 reasons to try it: 

1️⃣ **Rapid Development** 🏎️🏁 Boasts a library of 170+ hooks and components, allowing you to focus on the unique aspects of your application rather than repetitive CRUD operations.

2️⃣ **Customizable and Extensible** ✨💫 Built on a headless core, react-admin enables complete customization of your app's look and feel. And it gets out of the way when you need custom logic.

3️⃣ **Built-in Best Practices** 🤓 React-admin integrates 7 years of best practices in data fetching, performance, form handling, and security, ensuring a robust and enjoyable developer experience.

  
Best of all: it's free and seamlessly integrates with your API (no [SSO Tax](https://sso.tax/)). [**Try it now**](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/) 😉
