Hi everyone!

This week we have a nice Next.js release and many interesting community blog posts.

We can also feel that the React core team is working hard to polish the remaining details for React 19. Unexpectedly, a v18.3 is finally planned with extra warnings. React Native 0.74 is also around the corner.

This week I'd like to introduce you to [**ECMAScript News**](https://ecmascript.news/?utm_source=thisweekinreact). It's my favorite newsletter to keep up to date with ES, TC39, JS tooling, and runtimes.

Next week we have [React Connection](https://reactconnection.io/) and [React Native Connection](https://reactnativeconnection.io/) conferences in Paris. See you there for those that attend 👋. You can still get a [-20% discount](https://www.billetweb.fr/react-connection-2024?discount=TWIR) with my partner code "TWIR".

**[React-admin: The Open-Source Framework for B2B apps](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/)**

Used by 25,000 companies, React-admin is the leading framework for building ERPs, internal tools, and B2B apps with React. Here are 3 reasons to try it:

1️⃣ **Rapid Development** 🏎️🏁 Boasts a library of 170+ hooks and components, allowing you to focus on the unique aspects of your application rather than repetitive CRUD operations.

2️⃣ **Customizable and Extensible** ✨💫 Built on a headless core, react-admin enables complete customization of your app's look and feel. And it gets out of the way when you need custom logic.

3️⃣ **Built-in Best Practices** 🤓 React-admin integrates 7 years of best practices in data fetching, performance, form handling, and security, ensuring a robust and enjoyable developer experience.

Best of all: it's free and seamlessly integrates with your API (no [SSO Tax](https://sso.tax/)). [**Try it now**](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/) 😉

[**Next.js 14.2**](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-14-2)

Until we get React 19 and Next.js 15, this new minor version includes development, production, and caching improvements. The highlights are:

- Turbopack (RC): 99.8% of tests passing for `next dev --turbo`
- Build / Production Improvements: Reduced memory usage
- Caching Improvements: Configurable client-side cache revalidation with `staleTimes`
- Errors DX: Better hydration mismatch messages

I’m excited to see a great React hydration mismatch error dialog already implemented in Next.js! As I write this, Turbopack is 99.9% ready for development usage (6 integration tests missing). For build usage, it’s 75% ready so we’ll have to wait a bit more.

- 👀 [React Core - Upcoming v18.3 release](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/28843): The React team has finally decided to release a v18 minor version. It should not contain any behavior change but will emit new warnings for deprecated features to help us upgrade to React 19. It should warn us when using string refs, defaultProps on FC/memo components, or when spreading a key prop (🐦 [preview](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/status/1780519349247205589)).
- 👀 [React Core - useDeferredValue’s `initialValue`](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/pull/6747): In upcoming React 19 canary releases, this hook will take a new 2nd argument affecting the initial render. It will return the `initialValue` on initial render, and schedule a re-render in the background with the `value` returned.
- 👀 [React Core - Automatically reset forms after action finishes](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/28804): This new React 19 behavior only affects uncontrolled inputs, and aligns with the native platform behavior (it will now be the same with/without JS). It will only affect uncontrolled inputs. They also added a new public API [DOM.requestFormReset](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/28809) so that form abstraction authors can implement this behavior too.

- 📜 [Zustand and React Context](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/zustand-and-react-context): I cannot agree more with Dominik that suggests putting your Zustand store instance in a React context. This way, you can initialize the store from props, make things easier to test, and allow using a store on multiple subtrees.
- 📜 [CSS in React Server Components](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/css-in-rsc/): Josh explains why Styled-Components/Emotion do not play well with RSC, and presents alternative solutions providing a similar styled API, like Linaria, Panda, or Pigment. Avoid FOMO, there's no need to adopt RSCs and these libraries now if your app already works fine.
- 📜 [R19, a dead-simple React 19 framework - Part 2 - The Code; How it works under the hood!](https://www.cmrg.me/blog/rsc-part-2-the-code): Great technical deep dive into what it takes to create a custom React 19 / RSC / Server Actions setup on top of Bun.

It also explains the differences between the 2 approaches and lists the pros/cons of each implementation. There’s no clear winner, although Remix looks quite competitive!
- 📜 [The Two-Tree Problem with Styling on the Web](https://danielnagy.me/posts/Post_jt4adn0o5bnr): An interesting read on the DOM/CSS tree separation, and whether React CSS-in-JS or Tailwind solves this problem. The author is pro-inline-style (like me BTW).
