- 💸 [The Road to Next - Master Full-Stack Web Development with Next.js 15 and React 19](https://www.road-to-next.com/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=this_week_in_react_1.1)
- 📖 [TanStack Start \- Cloudflare Workers docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/tanstack/)
- 🐦 [Radix kicking off a weekly stream to show how Radix is developed and maintained](https://x.com/radix_ui/status/1940123605272244674): It looks like a good transparency move from the WorkOS team, probably reacting to last week’s [“Radis is a liability”](https://x.com/ccccjjjjeeee/status/1935163290998722660) drama. Meanwhile, its strongest competitor BaseUI released [beta.1](https://github.com/mui/base-ui/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.1).
- 🐦 [Guillermo Rauch \- “All areweturboyet.com tests are passing for Next.js production builds“](https://x.com/rauchg/status/1938668763525849298): So far, only dev builds were stable, but we can expect an upcoming Next.js release announcing much faster and production builds on Turbopack instead of Webpack. Note that [Rspack 1.4 also announced \~99% coverage of dev/production builds](https://rspack.rs/blog/announcing-1-4#next-rspack), and it will be interesting to see which tool performs faster once both bundlers are at 100%.
- 🐦 [Ryan Florence is studying React alternativese](https://x.com/ryanflorence/status/1938994450035789941) and [Michael Jackson is growing increasingly disillusioned with React hooks](https://x.com/mjackson/status/1937979887815692465), and it looks like they are brainstorming publicly what they plan to build for Remix v3.
- 😠 Alex Russell [rants about React Summit talks](https://infrequently.org/2025/06/conferences-clarity-and-smokescreens/) and Mario says [React Still Feels Insane](https://mbrizic.com/blog/react-is-insane/).
- 📜 [Remixing Shopify's Admin: How We Made It 30% Faster and AI-Ready](https://shopify.engineering/remixing-admin): Interesting feedback from Shopify migrating their massive flagship Admin app to Remix. It looks to me many recent React Router features were things Shopify actually needed.
- 📜 [The time is right for a DOM templating API](https://justinfagnani.com/2025/06/26/the-time-is-right-for-a-dom-templating-api/): Interesting thoughts on the lack of a templating language in JS from one of the original creators of Lit (Web Components), who also created a [proposal based on tagged template literals](https://justinfagnani.com/2025/06/30/what-should-a-dom-templating-api-look-like/). This also discusses how all this could integrate with React and JSX.
- 📜 [Next.js Promise Racing](https://playfulprogramming.com/posts/nextjs-promise-race): A really cool trick if you want to fully resolve promises on the server, unless they take too long, in which case it’s nice to show a Suspense fallback.

- 📦 [Stack \- Streamlining flexbox usage in React & React Native](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/stack): Convenient flexbox interface. It could also be helpful for cross-platform usage by reverting the default `flex-direction: column` from React Native.
- 📦 [Create Context Hook \- Simplify creating React Context with hooks](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/create-context-hook): A tiny but convenient pattern to ensure work is only done once per tree instead of once per hook call.
- 📦 [Ultracite 5.0 \- Zero-config Biome linter and formatter preset](https://www.ultracite.ai/): It comes with preconfigured rules optimized for Next.js, React and TypeScript projects, and can also help LLMs to generate correctly formatted code.

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

[![Nitro modules banner](/emails/issues/241/nitro.jpg)](https://nitro.margelo.com/)

**Nitro Week**

[Nitro Modules](https://nitro.margelo.com/) are trending among React Native lib developers, with 3 new releases this week:

- 📦 [React Native Nitro Image \- Superfast in-memory Image type and view component for React Native](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-nitro-image): Marc Rousavy releasing his new Image library that allows resizing/croping images without any file IO and should integrate later with VisionCamera (that will also use Nitro in the future).
- 📦 [React Native Video 7.0 alpha \- Rebuilt with Nitro modules, faster, supports preloading and player separated from view](https://github.com/TheWidlarzGroup/react-native-video/releases/tag/v7.0.0-alpha.0)
- 📦 [React Native HealthKit 9.0 \- Rebuilt with Nitro modules, improving performance and type-safety](https://github.com/kingstinct/react-native-healthkit/releases/tag/%40kingstinct%2Freact-native-healthkit%409.0.0)

- 🌐 In other universes, 🎥 [Compose Multiplatform for iOS is ready for production](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKTlW8Qkj0w), based on Kotlin/Skia. And 📣 [Swift announced an Android Working Group](https://forums.swift.org/t/announcing-the-android-workgroup/80666) and its intent to support the Android platform officially. I doubt this will significantly compete with React Native but it’s worth to be aware of\!

- 📦 [Expo Router AI App Generator](https://github.com/EvanBacon/app-that-builds-apps): Evan built an app that can build other Expo apps and websites.
