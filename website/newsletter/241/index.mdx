Hi everyone!

It's been a hot C° week here, but pretty calm in terms of React news. We still got various little releases, interesting blog posts and weak signals that show us what the future might look like.

On the React Native side, the community is adopting Nitro Modules in various libraries, and Skia got built-in support for Lottie animations.

ES2025 has been approved, and TS 5.9 beta should come anytime soon.

- 🐦 [Radix kicking off a weekly stream to show how Radix is developed and maintained](https://x.com/radix_ui/status/1940123605272244674): A good transparency move from the WorkOS team, probably in reaction to last week’s [“Radis is a liability”](https://x.com/ccccjjjjeeee/status/1935163290998722660) drama. Meanwhile, its upcoming competitor BaseUI released [beta.1](https://github.com/mui/base-ui/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.1).
- 🐦 [Guillermo Rauch \- “All areweturboyet.com tests are passing for Next.js production builds“](https://x.com/rauchg/status/1938668763525849298): So far, only dev builds were stable, but we can expect an upcoming Next.js release announcing much faster and production builds on Turbopack instead of Webpack. Note that [Rspack 1.4 also announced \~99% coverage of dev/production builds](https://rspack.rs/blog/announcing-1-4#next-rspack), and it will be interesting to see which tool performs faster once both bundlers are at 100%.
- 🐦 [Ryan Florence is studying React alternativese](https://x.com/ryanflorence/status/1938994450035789941) and [Michael Jackson is growing increasingly disillusioned with React hooks](https://x.com/mjackson/status/1937979887815692465), and it looks like they are brainstorming publicly what they plan to build for Remix v3, likely based on a fork of Preact.

- 📜 [Remixing Shopify's Admin: How We Made It 30% Faster and AI-Ready](https://shopify.engineering/remixing-admin): Interesting feedback from Shopify migrating their massive flagship Admin app to Remix. It looks to me many recent React Router features were things Shopify actually needed.
- 📜 [The time is right for a DOM templating API](https://justinfagnani.com/2025/06/26/the-time-is-right-for-a-dom-templating-api/): Interesting thoughts on the lack of a templating language in JS from one of the original creators of Lit (Web Components), who also created a [proposal based on tagged template literals](https://justinfagnani.com/2025/06/30/what-should-a-dom-templating-api-look-like/). This also discusses how all this could integrate with React and JSX.
- 📜 [Next.js Promise Racing](https://playfulprogramming.com/posts/nextjs-promise-race): A really cool trick if you want to fully resolve promises on the server, unless they take too long, in which case it’s nice to show a Suspense fallback.

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

[![Nitro modules banner](/emails/issues/241/nitro.jpg)](https://nitro.margelo.com/)

**Nitro Week**

[Nitro Modules](https://nitro.margelo.com/) are trending among React Native lib developers, with 3 new releases this week:

- 📦 [React Native Nitro Image \- Superfast in-memory Image type and view component for React Native](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-nitro-image): Marc Rousavy releasing his new Image library that allows resizing/croping images without any file IO and should integrate later with VisionCamera (that will also use Nitro in the future).
- 📦 [React Native Video 7.0 alpha \- Rebuilt with Nitro modules, faster, supports preloading and player separated from view](https://github.com/TheWidlarzGroup/react-native-video/releases/tag/v7.0.0-alpha.0)
- 📦 [React Native HealthKit 9.0 \- Rebuilt with Nitro modules, improving performance and type-safety](https://github.com/kingstinct/react-native-healthkit/releases/tag/%40kingstinct%2Freact-native-healthkit%409.0.0)

- 🌐 In other universes, 🎥 [Compose Multiplatform for iOS is ready for production](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKTlW8Qkj0w), based on Kotlin/Skia. And 📣 [Swift announced an Android Working Group](https://forums.swift.org/t/announcing-the-android-workgroup/80666) and its intent to support the Android platform officially. I doubt this will significantly compete with React Native but it’s worth to be aware of\!

It can compose with other Skia drawings, unlike [react-native-skottie](https://github.com/margelo/react-native-skottie).
- 📦 [Expo Router AI App Generator](https://github.com/EvanBacon/app-that-builds-apps): Evan built an app that can build other Expo apps and websites.
