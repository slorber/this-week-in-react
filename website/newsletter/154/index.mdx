Hi everyone!

Once again this week, we've got some great React articles, especially on Server Components!

Last week, I asked whether you preferred direct links or links to Twitter. Your answer was unanimous: **direct links**. On top of that, the Twitter/X experience has been degraded for anonymous users who can no longer see the discussions. So I'll try to avoid Twitter links, with a few exceptions for which I'll use the 🐦 emoji.

Awesome article on RSCs! Feedback that details the 3 main challenges encountered during the adoption at Mux: no CSS-in-JS, no React Context, and additional complexity. Also provides answers to many questions and a strategy for adopting RSCs incrementally.

The developers at BAM benchmarked the impact of the Hermes runtime on the app start-up time and memory consumption of a React-Native Android app using their [Flashlight](https://github.com/bamlab/flashlight) performance tool. For those who were still in doubt, Hermes clearly outperforms JSC.
