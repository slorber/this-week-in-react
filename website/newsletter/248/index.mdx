- 👀 [React Compiler PR \- Detect known incompatible libraries](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/34027): The compiler should soon be able to report incompatible libraries and skip optimizing them. By default, it will report React-Hook-Form’s `watch()` and TanStack Table’s `useReactTable()` APIs. Mobx is also incompatible, and may be reported later.

- 📜 [React Server Components support without a framework](https://krasimirtsonev.com/blog/article/vanilla-react-server-components-with-no-framework): This introduces Forket, a tool that lets you use RSCs in a framework/bundler-agnostic way. At build time, it splits your app into client/server parts and then stitches everything together at runtime.
- 📜 [Deriving Client State from Server State](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/deriving-client-state-from-server-state): Client/server state can get out of sync. TkDodo presents 2 underrated state derivation patterns that can replace `useEffect()` while keeping a consistent UI.
- 📜 [Using Activity with Suspenseful data](https://www.simeongriggs.dev/use-the-activity-boundary-to-hide-suspenseful-components): We often filter lists on the server or top-level client components, but this article presents an interesting case where you might want list items themselves to decide if they should be visible. Using the `<Activity>` component can improve item data preloading and preserve state.

[![React Native 1.0 is on the horizon!](/emails/issues/248/rn1.0.jpg)](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxNRvSqysWvHhAbISs741xfdSaJhvC_zDQ?si=mmAL0JFaxatwJVjB)

🎥 **[React Native 1.0 is on the horizon\!](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxNRvSqysWvHhAbISs741xfdSaJhvC_zDQ?si=mmAL0JFaxatwJVjB)**

Jorge Cohen from the Meta team announced today at React Universe that React Native 1.0 is on the horizon. Recently, the React Native team:

- streamlined the release process, moving from 2 releases in 2024 to 6 releases in 2025
- stabilized, reduced, and clarified the public JS and native API surfaces
- introduced automated workflows to catch RC bugs and breaking changes earlier

All this work sets the foundations to make it possible to release 1.0. It probably won't happen this year, but they will share their 1.0 release plan soon.

Make sure to watch the [React Universe Conf Live Streams](https://www.youtube.com/@CallstackEngineers/streams). This major RN event kicked off yesterday with the Core Contributor Summit and is currently underway until tomorrow. Many links below come directly from the event, and more are coming next week.

- 📣 [Introducing the React Native Nightly testing program](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/discussions/931): Maintainers of popular native libs can sign up for an automated testing program to ensure their lib keeps working against newer versions of React Native. The goal is to improve ecosystem stability and catch unexpected breaking changes early. As you can guess, this likely contributes to the 1.0 plan.
- 📣 [Expo Changelog \- Xcode 26 beta support for EAS Build and Workflows](https://expo.dev/changelog/xcode-26-0-beta-support-for-eas-build-and-workflows)

The Legacy Arch is already frozen, and starting 0.82 (now in RC), you won’t be able to use it anymore. However, the Legacy Arch APIs will only be fully removed in 0.83 and 0.84. The APIs used by the Interop Layer will stay.
