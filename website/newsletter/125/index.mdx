Hi everyone!

This week is **[Black Friday](/black-friday)**. I created a page with the best deals for a React dev. I already found some of them, but some are not announced yet, so come back on Friday ;)

[![Black Friday 2022 Banner](/img/BLACK_FRIDAY_2022_v2.png)](/black-friday)

I finally have the opportunity to put tRPC in the spotlight, with official releases and a great article comparing it to GraphQL!

We also have some great Remix-related content in general.

I like the direction React-Native takes!

Don't forget to fill out the [State Of JS](https://survey.devographics.com/survey/state-of-js/2022) survey! Glad Docusaurus made it this year. Feel free to suggest the newsletter for the resources üòè with some luck it will be featured next year üôå

**[FlyCode Makes React Apps Editable without coding, Git based](https://bit.ly/3UPwAoJ)**

[FlyCode](https://bit.ly/3wWSi00) (YC S22) makes React web apps editable in minutes so Product and UX teams can iterate and release products faster, so they don't have to wait on (or consume) developer time.

FlyCode reads your regular React code and finds Texts, Images, Design tokens and Analytics event, then it let's non-coders collaborate and edit them and send back a pull request (they don't need access to GitHub!)

- Saves development time
- No code integration, it just reads your code!
- GitHub based, a bot is scanning the code and creates pull requests
- Use your own stack and components
- Retain codebase ownership

You can get started here: [flycode.com/developers](https://www.flycode.com/developers)

[![tRPC 10](/emails/issues/125/trpc10.jpg)](https://trpc.io/blog/announcing-trpc-10)

**[tRPC 10](https://trpc.io/blog/announcing-trpc-10)**

Nice refactor of tRPC which greatly improves DX and IDE support. This library that facilitates typesafe backend calls is gaining more and more followers. It can be easily used in the React ecosystem thanks to the integration packages (Next.js, React-Query...). I love the tagline "Move Fast and Break Nothing" üòÑ

To understand the idea, I recommend reading [Why we ditched GraphQL for tRPC](https://echobind.com/post/why-we-ditched-graphql-for-trpc). Alex explains why they replaced GraphQL with tRPC in their [Bison](https://github.com/echobind/bisonapp) starter, in a React context. tRPC requires much less boilerplate, TypeScript codegen and JS bundle, while improving DX, IDE support and simplifying cache management. The way to handle over-fetching is different: you should not hesitate to create a new procedure. tRPC is ideal for a full-stack Node.js app in TypeScript with co-located backend/frontend code (Next.js for example). GraphQL remains a good solution to create a public API exposed to partners who do not necessarily use JavaScript and yet want to benefit from codegen (OpenAPI is also a good solution for this).

I take this opportunity to also mention [T3-App](https://create.t3.gg/), an end-to-end typesafe stack for Next.js based on tRPC, Prisma, Tailwind... It greatly helped tRPC grow in popularity this year, and now has an official docs site. Its [tRPC tdocs](https://create.t3.gg/en/usage/trpc) explain well the advantages compared to a classic Next.js Route API. See also [create-t3-turbo](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo): a Turborepo monorepo with Next.js + Expo, both using tRPC.

[![Working with Zustand](/emails/issues/125/zustand.jpg)](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/working-with-zustand)

**[Working with Zustand](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/working-with-zustand)**

Dominik reminds us where we come from in terms of state management. He explains why he likes Zustand, a minimalist and magic-free solution in the React philosophy. He gives some tips on how to best use it, like exposing custom hooks, using atomic selectors, or grouping actions in an immutable object. Good pragmatic tips I can definitively agree with!

[![Remix dual reponses](/emails/issues/125/remix-dual.png)](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2022/remix-alternate-timeline-of-web-dev/)

**[Remix and the Alternate Timeline of Web Development](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2022/remix-alternate-timeline-of-web-dev/)**

Jim explains that Remix has taken a few steps back to rethink our entire frontend app model. With Remix, progressive enhancement support does not require writing our app in 2 different ways (client + server) like with other frameworks, as Remix routes can return both JSON and HTML from the same code.

[![Taming the dragon: Accessible drag and drop](/emails/issues/125/dnd.jpg)](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/blog/drag-and-drop.html)

**[Taming the dragon: Accessible drag and drop](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/blog/drag-and-drop.html)**

Devon (Adobe) just announced the release of accessible drag & drop hooks for React-Aria and React-Spectrum. He explains how the keyboard and screen reader support works to allow users to select an element, and find potential targets with Tab, or the mobile experience. All this with many demos. It feels once again that there is a lot of work behind this React-Aria API, which is the first to try to solve this complex problem.

## üì± React-Native {#react-native}

**[\[Reply\] 2022: How can we improve React Native?](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/discussions/546)**

The React-Native team has officially responded to the discussion on [how to improve React-Native](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/discussions/528). We learn many details about the roadmap. The investment on React-Native seems to be accelerating. The points I'm particularly interested in are:

- Metro should catch up: swc, pnpm, symlinks, ESM support "exports"...
- Yoga and CSS support will be improved: flex gap, boxShadow...
- Cross-platform, unified APIs, React-Native-Web now under Meta ownership
- DX improvements: debugging, stacktraces, sourcemaps, LogBox...
