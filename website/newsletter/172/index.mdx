Hi everyone!

**[@ThisWeekInReact](https://twitter.com/ThisWeekInReact)** is our brand-new X account, hit subscribe! The promise is to share and retweet interesting things happening in the React community in near-real-time, and to be as **high-signal/low-noise** as possible.

This week React Server Components have been once-again the subject of various articles and discussions. The community has mitigated feelings about Next.js App Router. Even if people embrace the vision, they seem a little disappointed by its current implementation. Let's hope it's only temporary 🤞.

React Native has been particularly interesting this week. The [State of React Native](https://results.stateofreactnative.com/) survey results have been published, and the general feeling towards React Native is increasingly positive. There are also interesting bits related to Skia, Reanimated, or the bridgeless mode. The community is excited about Expo becoming a full-stack universal framework.

Happy reading!

[![Next.js Explained](/emails/issues/172/ppr.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTcPrTIBkpA)

🎥 [**Next.js Explained - Partial Prerendering**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTcPrTIBkpA)

It’s is not often that a video makes the headlines here, but this one is different for a few reasons.

First the topic is super interesting and well-explained with many animated visualizations. Partial pre-rendering is a [Next.js 14 experimental feature](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-14#partial-prerendering-preview) that completes the Next.js vision and offers the best of both worlds between static and dynamic rendering. This makes Next.js a multi-paradigm framework that supports all ranges of rendering diversity. This new feature is simple to adopt, builds on top of Suspense, and doesn’t introduce new APIs: you just need to turn a flag on.

Second: this incredibly well-produced video has been created with [Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev/), using React web code 🙉. Good job Delba, you nailed it! We can’t wait to see more videos like this and to know more about your Remotion creative process. On a related note, the Remotion team just shared theirs with a [behind the scene of GitHub Unwrapped 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WW8vIZ1kwR0).

[![State of React Native 2023 - Survey Results](/emails/issues/172/stateofrn.jpg)](https://results.stateofreactnative.com/)

**[State of React Native 2023 - Survey Results](https://results.stateofreactnative.com/)**

I’m a big fan of all the “State of …” surveys, because they give us a unique insight into what’s going on in the ecosystem. It’s one thing to follow the hype generated on X and elsewhere, but another thing to see stats of what developers actually use. So I’m really happy to see last year’s State of React Native results published! And as this is now the second year this survey is conducted, we can also identify some trends by comparing the results to the year before. For all the details, [have a look at the results yourself](https://results.stateofreactnative.com/)! I’ll just highlight a few things that I found interesting, some of them really surprised me:

- State management continues to be in a very interesting state (pun intended), with Redux taking the last place in retention with only 44 % (down from 57 % last year), but still clinging to second place after React’s native capabilities in terms of usage with 78 % (down from 85 %).
- Data fetching is a category where the results are in line with the amount of attention that can be observed on social media, with TanStack Query and tRPC taking top places in terms of interest and retention, and Meta’s own Relay staying mostly irrelevant outside of Meta with only 5 % usage.
- The future of navigation is Expo Router, which exploded from 12 % usage last year to 40 % today.
- Gauging by social media activity, styling seems to be the most talked about category with an abundance of options. In terms of usage, the classics (StyleSheet API, inline styling, styled components) remain the dominant options, with NativeWind and Tamagui catching up. Tamagui managed to generate the most interest in the past year (and also has the most retention and interest as a UI component library), closely followed by a new contender: react-native-unistyles.
- Special shoutout to Expo: In the “React Native tools” section, 6 out of the top 10 tools as well as the top 2 options in the deployment category are made by Expo.
- Over 85 % of respondents think that React Native is moving in the right direction and the share of developers that find that building RN apps is overly complex right now decreased from about 30 % to 25 % - that’s still too much, but we seem to be moving in the right direction!

Overall, really interesting results that are worth [checking out](https://results.stateofreactnative.com/) in detail! Many thanks to Bartłomiej, Kacper and Software Mansion for making this happen!
