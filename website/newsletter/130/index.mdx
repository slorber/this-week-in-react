Hi everyone and happy new year 2023 🍾🥂🥳️

In this holiday season, there was still quite a bit of activity with a Next.js release and some great React articles. And the React-Native ecosystem has been particularly active as well, with Tamagui, TypeScript support and 2 Shopify articles.

You are now over **15000 subscribers** reading me every week 😍

Thanks for your loyalty and contribution to the growth of this project. I'll be doing a 2022 retrospective soon to reveal everything. In the meantime, you'll find lots of info on my [Indie Hackers page](https://www.indiehackers.com/product/french-react-newsletter).

The newsletter is back early: I postponed my ski week, because there is not much snow 😅
Next edition on January 17th.

Oh, and I finally managed to create a [viral meme](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/status/1610243388174991360) 🥲

[![React Bricks is a CMS with visual editing based on React components](/emails/issues/128/reactbricks.png)](https://reactbricks.com/?utm_source=this_week_in_react)

**[React Bricks is a CMS with visual editing based on React components](https://reactbricks.com/?utm_source=this_week_in_react)**

**It's flexible for Developers**: create your own design system using React components, add Visual editing in your JSX and add sidebar controls to edit props like the background color. Choose Next.js, Gatsby or Remix and any CSS framework you like!

**It's easy for Content editors** who can directly edit in a visual way without breaking the design system: much easier than editing abstract entities using gray fields, as in a headless CMS. **And you save time**, as Content editors are autonomous!

**It's enterprise-ready** with Collaboration, Time-machine, Single Sign-on, GDPR-compliant datacenters, Global CDN for optimized images, E-commerce integration, Scheduled publishing and more.

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

[![Tamagui 1.0](/emails/issues/130/tamagui.jpg)](https://tamagui.dev/blog/version-one)

**[Tamagui 1.0](https://tamagui.dev/blog/version-one)**

Tamagui is officially out of beta, and makes it easy to create cross-platform projects (web and mobile) based on the same codebase in React, without losing on DX or performance. The project is divided into 3 parts:

- Tamagui Core: a CSS-in-JS runtime on top of React-Native and [React-Native-Web-Lite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-web-lite)
- Tamagui Static: a Babel-based compiler and Node pre-evaluation that supports view flattening and atomic CSS style extraction
- Tamagui UI: a library of React components and hooks for ease of use

Tamagui is an innovative project with positive feedback from styling and cross-platform thought leaders. It could be interesting even if you only target one platform. The support of React 18 features like Server Components, Concurrent Mode is already there. Worth giving it a try!

[![React Native Skia: A Year in Review and a Look Ahead](/emails/issues/130/skia.jpg)](https://shopify.engineering/react-native-skia-2022)

**[React Native Skia: A Year in Review and a Look Ahead](https://shopify.engineering/react-native-skia-2022)**

William Candillon makes a nice retrospective of the React-Native-Skia project. As a reminder, [Skia](https://skia.org/) is Google's 2D engine, used by Chrome, Android, Flutter... They have significantly improved the performance with UI Thread Rendering and a new declarative Skia DOM API. The library is flexible and can be extended (Skottie, VisionCamera frame processing). In 2023, we can expect to see animations via worklets, a more powerful integration with Reanimated, or text layout.

- 📊 [State of React-Native 2022](https://twitter.com/swmansion/status/1605957585684799493): the survey is open. I'll send a dedicated email soon because it's important that you answer it 😜
- 📜 [First-class Support for TypeScript](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2023/01/03/typescript-first): React-Native 0.71 should be released very soon with full TypeScript support by default: type definitions, documentation and starter template.
- 📜 [Shopify - Migrating our Largest Mobile App to React Native](https://shopify.engineering/migrating-our-largest-mobile-app-to-react-native): Shopify is in the process of incrementally migrating their main app to React-Native. It's a 6 years old app with more than 300 screens, with no particular technical debt. A very interesting feedback on this ongoing migration (still in the beginning, around 10% done). The first approach (new features in React-Native) had not worked. They finally opted to convert the root of the app first.
- 📜 [Implementing CSS Style Inheritance in React Native](https://www.builder.io/blog/implementing-css-style-inheritance-in-react-native): explains how to reproduce the CSS cascade in React-Native, a CSS behavior not implemented for good reasons. This is especially useful for integration with a CMS, which often assumes that you can apply text styling to a parent View, like it's possible on the web.
- 📜 [Google Drive auto-backup for React Native on Android](https://dev.to/retyui/google-drive-auto-backup-for-react-native-on-android-254a): to persist the async storage (or whatever) from one phone to another.
- 🎥 [How to use Bluetooth Low Energy ( BLE ) Beacons with React-Native](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hYM_sdQcBU)
