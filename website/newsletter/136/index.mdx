**[Build and Run Synthetic Monitoring That Scales](https://www.checklyhq.com/product/monitoring-as-code/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=this-week-in-react)**

You build it; you own it! It's a simple mantra that has driven software development for years. But how do you monitor complex React applications the best way?

- First: use Playwright to mimic user flows and guarantee that your app works.
- Second: be confident that the used APIs are up and running.

"Monitoring as Code" - is a new way to define, test & deploy your entire application monitoring directly from code.

- Code your monitoring setup and keep in version control
- Test your application in preview environments to avoid bugs and regressions
- Deploy your tests and start monitoring production
