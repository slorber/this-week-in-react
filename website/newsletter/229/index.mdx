Hi everyone!

This week, I'm excited to introduce 2 new contributors to help me with the newsletter!

**Tomasz and Kacper from [Software Mansion](https://swmansion.com/?utm_source=thisweekinreact)** here – you may already know us from libraries like Reanimated or Gesture Handler. We're happy to be among the authors of the This Week in React newsletter!

We were about to call it a fairly calm week… until React Conf 2025 was officially announced and React Native 0.79 dropped with Swift-compatible native modules for iOS, faster app startup on Android, and many more. Let's dive in!

**[React-admin: Yes, You Could Build It Yourself… But Why?](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/)**

You didn’t spend years mastering React just to build CRUD apps on repeat. Yet here you are—facing another request for an admin panel and questioning your life choices.

We've been there ourselves. That’s why we built [**react-admin**](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/)—an open-source framework that handles the boring parts (data fetching, forms, auth, permissions…) so you can focus on the real dev work.

Powered by **Material UI, react-hook-form, react-router, react-query, and TypeScript**, it lets you build admins on top of any REST/GraphQL API—fast.

So next time your PM asks for a new dashboard, skip the existential crisis. [Just use react-admin.](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin)

**[React Conf is back for 2025](https://conf.react.dev/)**

The React conference is happening on October 7-8, 2025 in Henderson, Nevada, 🇺🇸 US. It’s where the React & React Native team shares official announcements live.

The only way to attend the conference in person is to win a ticket lottery that lets you purchase up to 2 tickets. Fortunately, if you’re not one of the lucky ones, the event will be livestreamed for free.

[![React Native 0.79](/emails/issues/229/react-native-0.79.png)](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2025/04/08/react-native-0.79)

**[React Native 0.79 – Faster tooling and much more](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2025/04/08/react-native-0.79)**

Recently, the React Native core team switched to more frequent release cycles, so this is a smaller release, but nonetheless exciting in terms of performance improvements. Here are the highlights:

- Metro: 3x faster cold startup and package exports support
- JavaScriptCore (JSC) moving to a Community Package
- iOS: Swift-Compatible Native Modules registration
- Android: Faster app startup thanks to skipping the JS bundle compression
- Removal of Remote JS Debugging
