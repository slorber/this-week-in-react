Hi everyone!

This time it’s Tomasz and Kacper from [Software Mansion](https://swmansion.com/?utm_source=thisweekinreact) – you may already know us from libraries like Reanimated or Gesture Handler. We're happy to be among the authors of the This Week in React newsletter!

We were about to call it a fairly calm week… until React Native 0.79 dropped and React Conf 2025 was officially announced.

**[React-admin: Yes, You Could Build It Yourself… But Why?](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/)**

You didn’t spend years mastering React just to build CRUD apps on repeat. Yet here you are—facing another request for an admin panel and questioning your life choices.

We've been there ourselves. That’s why we built [**react-admin**](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/)—an open-source framework that handles the boring parts (data fetching, forms, auth, permissions…) so you can focus on the real dev work.

Powered by **Material UI, react-hook-form, react-router, react-query, and TypeScript**, it lets you build admins on top of any REST/GraphQL API—fast.

So next time your PM asks for a new dashboard, skip the existential crisis. [Just use react-admin.](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin)
