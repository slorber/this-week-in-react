Hi everyone!

This week, TypeScript 5.1 is released in beta with many improvements related to JSX and React!

React-Query plans to remove query callbacks in version 5, and this idea does not please everyone.

For React-Native developers, don't miss [React-Native-Connection](https://reactnativeconnection.io/) on June 1st in Paris! I participated to the talks selection committee, and we just [published the complete line-up](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/status/1648269027318411264) with international and local speakers. 10% discount with the code "REACTHEBDO".

## ⚛️ React {#react}

[![TypeScript 5.1 beta](/emails/issues/142/ts5.1.jpg)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-1-beta/)

**[TypeScript 5.1 (beta) + React](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-1-beta/)**

An important TypeScript release that will allow React to be able to declare its own valid JSX types. It is planned to use this new feature as soon as possible in React typedefs, which have already been [forked](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/65126) to continue to support older versions (TypeScript \<= 5.0).

There are good reasons to adopt TypeScript 5.1+ as soon as possible. It unlocks among other things:

- the ability to use a React Server Component `async` in JSX without TypeScript errors or [workaround](https://gist.github.com/cramforce/b5e3f0b103f841d2e5e429b1d5ac4ded).
- the ability to return all valid types for `ReactNode` (string, array, boolean...) without needing a fragment ([details](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/status/1648619398259769344)).
- other interesting improvements around JSX: namespaced attributes and linked editing (VSCode).

[![Breaking React Query's API on purpose](/emails/issues/142/rq.jpg)](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/breaking-react-querys-api-on-purpose)

**[Breaking React Query's API on purpose](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/breaking-react-querys-api-on-purpose)**

React-Query will remove the callbacks (`onSuccess`, `onError`, `onSettled`) from the `useQuery` hook with v5. Dominik explains this choice and suggest alternatives more adapted to common cases, like displaying a toast. A controversial but necessary decision because these APIs were often misused. Note: callbacks are kept for `useMutation`.
