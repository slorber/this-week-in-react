**[AI Localization That Actually Understands React](https://l.crowdin.com/Gh5y9Pp)**

Stop wasting time fighting your i18n keys. 😫 Crowdin is the perfect, automated l10n solution built for React developers – whether you're an individual or a startup.

The days of manually providing context are over:

- **Context Harvester:** Our open-source CLI uses Agentic AI to **scan your code** and automatically attach usage context to every string. It knows if "Close" is a button, a component name, or a modal title. No more guesswork for the AI. 🤯
- **Smarter AI Translations:** With that precise context, our pre-translation engine delivers production-ready strings instantly.
- **Integrations:** Connect Crowdin directly to your repo. Localization becomes a simple, continuous part of your CI/CD pipeline.

Launch a multilingual app without breaking a sweat. Focus on features, not fighting files🚀
