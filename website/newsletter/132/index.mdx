Hi everyone!

This week we have some nice releases with Astro 2.0 and Remix 1.11. Also some interesting content around Server Components.

React-Native is not left out with Expo Router in release candidate, Expo Image in beta, and a new solution to create Android widgets.

I was invited to the show [Learn With Jason - Create and deploy a documentation website](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/create-and-deploy-a-documentation-website?utm_source=thisweekinreact) in which Jason makes his first steps on Docusaurus.

Discover the [ES.next News newsletter](https://esnextnews.com/?utm_source=thisweekinreact), a good source of information to keep up to date on the evolution of the JavaScript language, the TC39 committee and JS tooling like ESLint, Babel, Bun, Prettier...

## ⚛️ React {#react}

[![Astro 2.0](/emails/issues/132/astro2.jpg)](https://astro.build/blog/astro-2/)

**[Astro 2.0](https://astro.build/blog/astro-2/)**

Astro releases its v2. New features highlighted:

- Content Collections: Automatic type-safety for Markdown & MDX.
- Hybrid Rendering: Static? Dynamic? Get the best of both worlds.
- Redesigned Error Overlays
- Improved Dev Server (HMR)
- Vite 4.0
- Public Roadmap

See also the article [Introducing Content Collections: Type-Safe Markdown in Astro 2.0](https://astro.build/blog/introducing-content-collections/). It's about validating the front matter with Zod, to be able to use this data in a typed way in React components, and to have good error messages displayed with a good DX when front matter data that doesn't respect the schema. Definitely a good idea, by the way [Docusaurus does it too](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/4591) 😜.

[![Remix 1.11](/emails/issues/132/remix0.11.jpg)](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/releases/tag/remix%401.11.0)

**[Remix 1.11](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/releases/tag/remix%401.11.0)**

A nice Remix release with the main new features:

- `defer` + `<Await>` to initiate a streamed response. The loader can return promises that will be awaited later on the client side.
- [Route Convention v2](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/file-conventions/route-files-v2): a new convention (flat routes) that can be activated now and will become the default convention in v2.
- Experimental support for CSS imports, CSS Modules, Vanilla Extract.

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

[![Expo Router RC](/emails/issues/132/expo-router.jpg)](https://blog.expo.dev/announcing-the-expo-router-v1-release-candidate-c5680b88a18c)

**[Expo Router v1 Release Candidate](https://blog.expo.dev/announcing-the-expo-router-v1-release-candidate-c5680b88a18c)**

Expo Router proposes to create your mobile navigation (still based on React-Navigation) using file-system naming conventions, as do most React web frameworks already. We can find the usual features like layout routes, dynamic routes, error boundaries...

The most interesting for me: the universal support. Navigation is based on links, a `<Link>` component and Metro web support (experimental). Now that the native part of Expo is working well, I wouldn't be surprised to see Expo gradually become a universal full-stack framework, and realize [Andrew Clark's prediction](https://twitter.com/acdlite/status/1489755769876754434).
