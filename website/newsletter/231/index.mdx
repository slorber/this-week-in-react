**[Convex: The Database Designed for AI Coding](https://convex.link/thisweekai)**

In the age of code generation, you need a backend that you can confidently generate with AI platforms. Convex is by far and away [best in class](https://stack.convex.dev/introducing-fullstack-bench) in this respect.

This is because Convex is just TypeScript, allowing you to write [queries as code](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions/) that are automatically transactional, cached, and realtime.

And that’s just the beginning. With Convex, you can:

*   Easily schedule functions and write cron jobs
    
*   Set up file storage
    
*   Write efficient server functions
    
*   And so much more…
