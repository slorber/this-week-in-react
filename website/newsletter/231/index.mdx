Hi everyone!

Cyril and Matthieu from [Theodo Apps](https://apps.theodo.com/en?utm_source=thisweekinreact) here 👋, standing in for Seb to bring you the latest news from the React and React Native worlds.

This week, we have two exciting blog posts for the React team, and a special guest from the React core team has a message for you all!

We've also been reading quite a few interesting blog posts from the "official" blogs and the community.

**[Convex: The Database Designed for AI Coding](https://convex.link/thisweekai)**

In the age of code generation, you need a backend that you can confidently generate with AI platforms. Convex is by far and away [best in class](https://stack.convex.dev/introducing-fullstack-bench) in this respect.

This is because Convex is just TypeScript, allowing you to write [queries as code](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions/) that are automatically transactional, cached, and realtime.

And that’s just the beginning. With Convex, you can:

- Easily schedule functions and write cron jobs
- Set up file storage
- Write efficient server functions
- And so much more…

## 📣 From the React team {#react-core-team}

[![React Labs: View Transitions, Activity, and more](/emails/issues/231/labs.jpg)](https://react.dev/blog/2025/04/23/react-labs-view-transitions-activity-and-more)

**[React Labs: View Transitions, Activity, and more](https://react.dev/blog/2025/04/23/react-labs-view-transitions-activity-and-more)**

The rumors you’ve heard that the React Team only cares about the server have been greatly exaggerated.

In our [React Labs post](https://react.dev/blog/2025/04/23/react-labs-view-transitions-activity-and-more) today, we shared that [View Transitions](https://react.dev/reference/react/ViewTransition) and [Activity](https://react.dev/reference/react/Activity) are now ready to try out in our experimental channel, along with docs for each. These new features allow React running on the client to animate UI transitions, and hide and show parts of the UI as the user navigates client-side. They work with server features, but are aimed at solving problems on the client.

We also [shared updates](https://react.dev/blog/2025/04/23/react-labs-view-transitions-activity-and-more#features-in-development) on problem areas we’re focusing on that impact client-rendered apps including better profiling tools, automatically compiling effect dependencies, a potential IDE extension, fragment refs, and yes even a concurrent store. These are problem areas we’ve wanted to address for a while, which recent features like the React Compiler and the `use` API allow us to finally tackle.

These features are still early and might change significantly before they’re ready to try. You can follow along while we build these features, and this newsletter is a great way to stay up to date. But don’t stress about learning everything \- you can let us cook first.

When we’re more confident a feature will ship, we’ll announce it on the blog and publish docs, like we’re doing today for View Transitions and Activity.

Give the new experimental features a try, and check out the areas we’re working on in the [blog post](https://react.dev/blog/2025/04/23/react-labs-view-transitions-activity-and-more).

[![React Compiler RC](/emails/issues/231/compiler.jpg)](https://react.dev/blog/2025/04/21/react-compiler-rc)

**[React Compiler RC](https://react.dev/blog/2025/04/21/react-compiler-rc)**

The React Labs post is not the only exciting update this week! The React Compiler is also in Release Candidate, in preparation of the compiler’s stable release.

The Babel-free builds is a welcome improvement so that we can keep using the compiler with our modern Rust tooling!

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

[![Legend List 1.0](/emails/issues/231/legend-list.png)](https://bsky.app/profile/jayz.us/post/3lni5ofbuvs2s)

**[Legend List 1.0](https://bsky.app/profile/jayz.us/post/3lni5ofbuvs2s)**

Making long lists performant is a hard problem, and React Native’s old architecture wasn’t making it any easier with it’s asynchronous layout computation. We remember Margelo abandoning their `WishList` project.
Legend List is now in version 1.0, and promises to be even faster than `FlashList`, all the while handling the "hard cases": bidirectional infinite lists, varying item sizes… And it's compatible with the old arch (though less performant and with possible glitches).

As Seb mentioned last week, there’s also a [v2 of `FlashList`](https://github.com/Shopify/flash-list/tree/new-rlv-prototype) in the works, which should be easier to use (no need to specify estimatedItemSize for instance).

Thankfully, all those copy the API of `FlatList` so it’s easy to switch back and forth 🙂.
