Hi everyone!

This week React developers have either been super grateful or busy spending money on useless things. Luckily, Astro is here to make the headline. We also have 2 great React perf articles.

The React Native ecosystem has been more active, with the official launch of Radon IDE, and many interesting releases.

Node 22.12 is here, with `require(esm)` enabled by default in LTS! There's also a TC39 meeting in progress with ES proposals progressing, but that's for next week!

[![Astro 5.0](/emails/issues/212/astro.jpg)](https://astro.build/blog/astro-5/)

**[Astro 5.0](https://astro.build/blog/astro-5/)**

A new major version of Astro just dropped. While technically not a pure React framework, it’s still widely used in the React community, can easily integrate interactive React components, and relies on MDX. The headlines are:

- Content Layer to bring all of your content into one friendly, type-safe data store. Including from CMS, APIs, and other sources.
- Server Islands for serving an initial page response as fast as possible, while keeping the ability to interleave dynamic content into a mostly static layout. A quite interesting and simpler alternative to React Server Components and Next.js Partial Pre-Rendering.
- Simplified prerendering, removing the “hybrid” option
- Type-safe environment variables
- Vite 6 with the new Environment API
- Experimental features: image cropping, responsive image layouts, SVG components

- 📜 [Storybook Component Testing for RSCs](https://storybook.js.org/blog/component-testing-rscs/): Testing RSCs usually requires E2E tests, and Storybook proposes an alternative strategy (experimental) that runs faster, directly in the browser, after mocking server IOs.

[![Radon IDE 1.0](/emails/issues/212/radon.jpg)](https://ide.swmansion.com/)

**[Radon IDE 1.0](https://ide.swmansion.com/)**

Software Mansion created a VSCode extension (also supporting Cursor) that turns your editor into a fully fledged IDE for React Native and Expo. It’s now officially launched as a stable version. It’s a paid product, but considering the low price and the DX improvement, it’s a no-brainer that also supports the company's great open source efforts. Take a look at the [Radon IDE launch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Un9EfE8D4) to have a quick overview of the features: simulators panel and settings, debugging, click-to-inspect, URL-driven navigation, storybook integration, and more.
