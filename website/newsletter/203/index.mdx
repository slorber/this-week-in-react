Hi everyone!

This week we have a lot of interesting news and releases!

There's notably an important terminology change for Server Actions, and a preview of upcoming React DevTools v6.

On the React Native side we also have a broad set of interesting news and previews of exciting packages!

Also, my meme game is back. You'll understand at the end 😂

[![Server Actions have been renamed to Server Functions](/emails/issues/203/serverfunctions.jpg)](https://19.react.dev/reference/rsc/server-functions)

**[Server Actions have been renamed to Server Functions](https://19.react.dev/reference/rsc/server-functions)**

It’s not a code change, but it’s an impactful terminology change that is now officially published on the React v19 docs site. Server Actions are now considered a subset of a broader Server Function feature. It only becomes an action when used within:

- `<form action>`
- `useActionState()`
- `startTransition()`

This change clarifies that “use server” is about exposing a server endpoint, not necessarily limited to mutations. Fetching data and JSX with Server Functions might not be an anti-pattern after all.

**About Next.js Server Actions**: they use `POST` requests and run sequentially, but this is a Next.js implementation detail and React doesn’t prevent you from running actions in parallel. The Next.js team has confirmed their intention to introduce new APIs to call Server Functions with `GET`.

[![React DevTools 6.0](/emails/issues/203/devtools.jpg)](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/packages/react-devtools/CHANGELOG.md#600)

**[React DevTools 6.0](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/packages/react-devtools/CHANGELOG.md#600)**

The React DevTools have been the focus of a lot of work recently, notably the ability to present a unified easy-to-understand React tree for Server and Client components. The browser extensions have not been published, but the v6 changelog is available with many PRs and screenshots to look at. From what I see, the team has done an incredible work to provide a great DX around element inspection, profiling, logging, stacktraces, sourcemaps.
