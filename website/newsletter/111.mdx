## React

[**Reassure**](https://github.com/callstack/reassure?utm_campaign=This%20Week%20In%20React&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)

Reassure is a new React performance test library. Already presented previously, it has now been open-sourced by Callstack. It allows to post a report in a pull-request when perf regressions are detected. Example: a component that re-renders more slowly, or more often than before. For the moment only React-Native is supported, but web support will come very soon.

[**10 Years Of Meteor**](https://meteor10.sachagreif.com/?utm_campaign=This%20Week%20In%20React&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)

Sacha Grief (co-author of Discover Meteor, and also of the State of JS, CSS surveys...) takes a look back at 10 years of his personal history with the framework. Meteor has lost popularity, but remains used and has greatly influenced our frontend ecosystem.

[**The mystery of React Element, children, parents and re-renders**](https://www.developerway.com/posts/react-elements-children-parents?utm_campaign=This%20Week%20In%20React&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)

## React-Native

[**FlashList - Fast & Performant React Native List**](https://shopify.github.io/flash-list/?utm_campaign=This%20Week%20In%20React&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)

Shopify has just released FlashList, its alternative to FlatList to solve performance issues when scrolling and avoid showing empty cells. The goal is to keep 60fps even on low-end Android devices, without complicating the implementation. The library reuses already rendered cells: you'll have to adapt your use of React `key` to let it take over.

Lists the API support of each React-Native runtime (JSC, V8, Android...) in a comprehensive way. The author also explains [why React Native recommends TS config lib: "es2017"](https://dev.to/retyui/why-react-native-typescript-config-recommends-to-use-a-five-years-old-standard-lib-es2017-3bjk?utm_campaign=This%20Week%20In%20React&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)
