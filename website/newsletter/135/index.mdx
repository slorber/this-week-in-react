**[Extensible JavaScript libraries for surveys and forms](https://surveyjs.io/)**

[SurveyJS](https://github.com/surveyjs) is a set of open-source JavaScript form libraries that you can easily integrate into your web app. It lets you **create and run multiple forms**, retaining all sensitive data on your servers, or have **your own self-hosted WYSIWYG form builder** that non-tech users can use directly.

You can also **analyze survey results** in custom-built dashboards, save your forms to PDF, or simply **convert them to editable PDF files**. It offers native support for **React and Angular rendering** and total freedom of choice as to the backend, because **any server + database combination is fully compatible**.
