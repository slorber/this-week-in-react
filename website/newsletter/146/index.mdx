Hi everyone!

Here we are with 2 weeks of React news. There are quite a few good React articles, and also some very interesting React-Native announcements related to the conferences that took place recently. Between Remix Conf, App.js, Chain React... it's hard to keep up with everything, not to mention React-Native-Connection and React Summit next week!

Data fetching libraries like React-Query and Apollo are wondering about their integration with Server Components and Next.js App Router. We start to see more clearly.

The newsletter is skipping another week: next issue on June 7th 👋

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

[![RN Skia talk](/emails/issues/146/skia.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfb_gpfCHzk)

**[Write Once, Route Everywhere: File System-based Navigation for Native Apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=608r8etX_cg)**

Evan Bacon presents at App.js the features planned for Expo Router v2. See also this [thread](https://twitter.com/Baconbrix/status/1656634363847507968). The use of universal links has many UX benefits. Expo continues to invest in web support, which is progressing well with the latest advances in the Metro bundler. There is even CSS support planned. Expo could well start to compete with Next.js on the web?
