Hi everyone!

This week is pretty busy for an end of the year 🤪 I'll let you discover it all.

My [episode for the React Round Up podcast](https://topenddevs.) is online. It's about the latest React 18 features, MDX or even Docusaurus.

👋 Last edition of the year. The newsletter will be back on January 10th!

🎄 Happy holidays 🎅

[![React Bricks is a CMS with visual editing based on React components](/emails/issues/128/reactbricks.png)](https://reactbricks.com/?utm_source=this_week_in_react)

**[React Bricks is a CMS with visual editing based on React components](https://reactbricks.com/?utm_source=this_week_in_react)**

**It's flexible for Developers**: create your own design system using React components, add Visual editing in your JSX and add sidebar controls to edit props like the background color. Choose Next.js, Gatsby or Remix and any CSS framework you like!

**It's easy for Content editors** who can directly edit in a visual way without breaking the design system: much easier than editing abstract entities using gray fields, as in a headless CMS. **And you save time**, as Content editors are autonomous!

**It's enterprise-ready** with Collaboration, Time-machine, Single Sign-on, GDPR-compliant datacenters, Global CDN for optimized images, E-commerce integration, Scheduled publishing and more.

[![Storybook 7.0 beta](/emails/issues/129/storybook7.png)](https://storybook.js.org/blog/7-0-beta/)

**[Storybook 7.0 beta](https://storybook.js.org/blog/7-0-beta/)**

Storybook officially announces the release of v7 in beta. The final version will be released in a few months. It's a very big update with a migration plan and even tools to help us upgrade. A subset of the major changes:

- Design and performance improvements
- Tests: interaction testing, Playwright, coverage reporting
- Documentation in MDX 2
- Component Story Format 3.0
- API frameworks: Vite, Next.js, SvelteKit

[![OpenNEXT - Open source Next.js serverless adapter](/emails/issues/129/opennext.png)](https://github.com/serverless-stack/open-next)

**[OpenNEXT - Open source Next.js serverless adapter](https://github.com/serverless-stack/open-next)**

A project that aims to improve the portability of Next.js to serverless platforms, including **all** features (SSR, but also ISR, middleware, Image Optimization). For the moment, OpenNEXT only allows to deploy on AWS.

Ryan Florence said [Next.js is not really open-source](https://twitter.com/ryanflorence/status/1600526114010845184), and this led to interesting debates. Theo Browne's video sums the situation well: [Is NextJS A Trap? Vendor Lock In Rant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhdO8f_45CA). Vercel doesn't seem to do vendor lock-in, but at the same time it's normal their platform remains the best to deploy Next.js apps.

---

[![React Email](/emails/issues/129/reactemail.png)](https://react.email/)

**[React Email](https://react.email/)**

New solution to create emails based on React and TypeScript. In practice, it is a renderer and a set of headless components compatible with popular email clients, as well as an interface to develop emails with a good DX. The [demo](https://demo.react.email/) reproduces some emails from Vercel, Airbnb, Stripe... It looks like a modern version of [React-MJML](https://github.com/wix-incubator/mjml-react), including a preview interface.

[![React Router 6.5](/emails/issues/129/reactrouter6.5.png)](https://twitter.com/remix_run/status/1603887581770354688)

**[React Router 6.5](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/releases/tag/react-router%406.5.0) + [Remix 1.9](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/releases/tag/remix%401.9.0)**

2 related releases that mark the [end of the React-Router-ing Remix project](https://twitter.com/ryanflorence/status/1604257159876730881) (moving the Remix code into React-Router), and the reintroduction of a useful feature: [optional route segments](https://twitter.com/remix_run/status/1603887581770354688).

- 📖 Beta docs: [useLayoutEffect](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1603772620641431553). All API ref pages are available. The beta site should be available soon.
- 👀 [useEvent => useEffectEvent](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/25881): this anticipated React API is renamed and the scope reduced a bit. useEffectEvent is not made to optimize re-renders by stabilizing callbacks.
- 🎅 [GitHub Unwrapped 2022](https://www.githubunwrapped.com/): generates a video that summarizes your GitHub activity in 2022. The video is produced with React and [Remotion](https://remotion.dev/).

An interesting lever to use for the performance of apps/pages with short sessions.
- 📜 [SvelteKit Auth: Bringing NextAuth.js to all frameworks](https://vercel.com/blog/announcing-sveltekit-auth): it's NextAuth's turn to become agnostic. The project becomes Auth.js and now supports Next.js + SvelteKit.

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

[![Pointer Events in React Native](/emails/issues/129/pointer.png)](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2022/12/13/pointer-events-in-react-native)

**[Pointer Events in React Native](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2022/12/13/pointer-events-in-react-native)**

The [Pointer Events](https://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents3/) web API is being ported to React-Native. This is very good news for cross-platform. It should also facilitate the use of features like hover and right-click using React-Native JSX elements, which where not initially designed to support these features.

---

[![Expo-MDX](/emails/issues/129/expo-mdx.png)](https://twitter.com/Baconbrix/status/1603053674548367360)

**[Expo-MDX](https://twitter.com/Baconbrix/status/1603053674548367360)**

Evan Bacon releases a package to facilitate the use of MDX on React-Native. Metro compiles MDX into React components, and a provider substitutes DOM elements (default target of MDX) with React-Native elements that you can style easily. We can expect some upcoming usage in Expo-Router, like the ability to create a new React-Navigation screen by creating a simple `.mdx` file? 👌

MDX support on React-Native is a topic that I particularly like. See also my talk [React Native EU 2020 - Cross-platform: ReactNative, Jamstack, And Beyond](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScgFQojbAAc) or my article [Using Expo in Gatsby](https://sebastienlorber.com/using-expo-in-gatsby).

Profiling, network inspection... it still seems a bit complicated to get everything working properly.
- 📜 [No, React Native is not the future](https://blog.standardnotes.com/40921/no-react-native-is-not-the-future): story of an app that wanted to have only one codebase for web and mobile. In the end, they chose to use a WebView in a React-Native shell.
