Hi everyone!

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! 🥂

The newsletter is back for another year. Despite the holiday season we still had some interesting news, notably regarding the TanStack. Developers probably took this opportunity to work on their own open-source side projects 😄!

Don't forget to answer the [State of React Native 2023 survey](https://stateofreactnative.com/), it's your last chance!

Once again, this issue now has 2 authors [Benedikt](https://twitter.com/bndkt) is helping me.

I hope to find time to write a full 2023 retrospective of the newsletter. Until then, if you are curious, I write monthly reports on my [Indie Hackers page](https://www.indiehackers.com/product/french-react-newsletter) for 2 years now.

[![TanStack Router 1.0](/emails/issues/168/tanstack-router.jpg)](https://tanstack.com/router/v1)

**[TanStack Router 1.0](https://tanstack.com/router/v1)**

The highly anticipated TanStack Router launched as stable 1.0 with a nice [🐦 trailer](https://twitter.com/tannerlinsley/status/1738709130213560497), just in time for Christmas. This new router pushes the boundary of what is possible in terms of type-safety, url state management (search params) and caching, among other things.

The [SSR guide](https://tanstack.com/router/v1/docs/guide/ssr) reference a `@tanstack/react-start` package, probably a teaser for an upcoming [🐦 TanStack Start framework](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/status/1742589454563369123)

Other recent TanStack packages that you might have missed:

- 📦 [TanStack Config - Tool for publishing and maintaining high-quality JavaScript packages](https://github.com/TanStack/config)
- 📦 [TanStack Store - Framework agnostic, type-safe store with reactive framework adapters](https://tanstack.com/store/latest)
