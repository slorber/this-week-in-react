[![TanStack DB 0.5 — Query-Driven Sync](/emails/issues/258/tanstack.jpg)](https://tanstack.com/blog/tanstack-db-0.5-query-driven-sync)

**[TanStack DB 0.5 — Query-Driven Sync](https://tanstack.com/blog/tanstack-db-0.5-query-driven-sync)**

A collection shouldn't dictate what data loads: Your queries should. This concept is now implemented in TanStack DB with a new `syncMode: ‘eager’ | ‘on-demand’ | ‘progressive’` option. This moves the library closer to how GraphQL clients like Apollo/Relay work, where components declare their data dependency, and the client figures out how to load and maintain that data. This can be adapted to work on top of any existing backend API, as long as you provide code to map the query predicates into actual API calls.

[![Valdi - Cross-platform UI framework](/emails/issues/258/valdi.jpg)](https://github.com/Snapchat/Valdi)

**[Valdi \- Cross-platform UI framework](https://github.com/Snapchat/Valdi)**

Snapchat released a beta version of the cross-platform UI framework they've used in production apps for the last 8 years. It’s not based on React, but also uses a similar declarative model and relies on the Yoga layout engine. TypeScript components are compiled directly to native iOS, Android, and macOS views.
