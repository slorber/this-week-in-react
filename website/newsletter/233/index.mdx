Hi everyone!

This week we don't have one, but 2 interesting blog posts from Dan Abramov, and various React releases.

I found the mobile news particularly interesting, with Expo 53, Skia Graphite, Reanimated Shared Elements Transitions, and the Apple fees court injunction.

My fellows at ui.dev are also launching the final content of their [react.gg](https://react.gg/?ref=twir) course (30% off now), designed to teach you all the brand-new React 19 concepts from first principles. I got access to review it and can assure you that it's a really playful way to learn React, full of interactive examples, visualizations and pragmatic quizzes.

[![Game On - Bringing WebGPU to React Native](/emails/issues/233/skia.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9t-VXwIc4I)

**[🎥 Game On \- Bringing WebGPU to React Native](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9t-VXwIc4I)**

In a 37-minute video packed with exciting announcements, William Candillon and guests gave us a glimpse into the future of drawing and animation. Supported by Shopify, he’s bringing modern WebGPU support (Vulkan and Metal) to React Native.

By aligning to the web APIs, it's possible to copy/paste existing web examples (including Three.js) and make them work on all platforms. It also enables general-purpose use of the GPU (AI, TensorFlow.js), which you may achieve more easily thanks to a convenient low-level TypeGPU library.

All this work was needed to create a new experimental Skia Graphite backend based on WebGPU. It enables composing and interleaving 2D/3D experiences in a performant way, like on the web, but across all platforms, with full Reanimated integration. Along the way, Skia doesn’t come with any new feature, but has significantly improved performance, reduced, crashes, and supports 3 new platforms: tvOS, macOS and Node. Keep massaging that octopus William\!

A major event for the mobile industry that enables Fortnite to return, the Kindle app to finally sell e-books directly, and new business models. Check [Expo](https://expo.dev/blog/mobile-app-payment-processing-best-practices) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/blog/ios-developers-can-now-offer-commission-free-payments-on-web) guides and starters to avoid the fee.

It looks like in the future we’ll be able to use a web-like IntersectionObserver to know when a React fragment enters the screen. Still research/work-in-progress, but exciting new features ahead.
