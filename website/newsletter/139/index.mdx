Hi everyone!

The new React site is finally out, and it's safe to say that it kicks ass 🤗 I've put up quite a few related links, and will let you make up your own mind!

There are also some really cool articles. I like the interactive map of React APIs, Remix's approach to breaking changes for v2, or the use of React-Server-Components for translations.

On the React-Native side, the first RC of v0.72 is out. Some long-awaited new features of Metro 0.76 should be available soon, like symlinks support!

## ⚛️ React {#react}

[![Introducing react.dev](/emails/issues/139/reactdev.jpg)](https://react.dev/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-react-dev)

**[Introducing react.dev](https://react.dev/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-react-dev)**

The new React website is finally online! A new article comes with this launch. It's a very big project (both tech and content) that required several years of efforts and many collaborators.

What I like in particular:

- The focus on hooks and functional components
- The guides with many diagrams, illustrations and interactive challenges
- The emphasis of React as a cross-platform solution, not web-only
- API pages well separated in references/usage, current/deprecated, client/server
- The overall consistency of the whole experience

Some changes were also controversial this week, in particular the fact of recommending only a small list of frameworks to start a new React project (Next.js, Remix, Gatsby, Expo) but not recommending many others (Vite, Create-React-App, client-side SPA...).

[![Map of React API](/emails/issues/139/reactmap.jpg)](https://julesblom.com/writing/map-of-react-api)

**[Map of React API](https://julesblom.com/writing/map-of-react-api)**

A spatial and interactive representation of the React APIs, with references to great external articles for each of these APIs. I think it's a great idea and a good opinionated complement to the official documentation.

---

- 👀 [React PR - Suspend commit without blocking render](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/26398): a feature that will be used internally first, especially on resources (CSS, font, images). When navigating with startTransition, React will be able to wait a bit until the images of the next page are loaded before commiting the transition ([details](https://twitter.com/acdlite/status/1637102880850059264)).
- 👀 [React PR - Remove layout effect warning on the server](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/26395): the SSR warning for useLayoutEffect will be removed. Dan Abramov comments on [useIsomorphicLayoutEffect](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1636176793592905729).
- 🧵 [Tim Neutkens on improving `next export`](https://twitter.com/timneutkens/status/1636693508223270912): compatible with App Router, Server Components...
- 📜 [Future Proofing Your Remix App](https://remix.run/blog/future-flags): Remix explains their strategy for deploying breaking changes on major releases. They plan to introduce "Future flags" that allow you to opt-in for planned breaking changes in advance. If you managed to activate all flags in v1, it should be easy to upgrade to v2.
- 📜 [Internationalization In Next.js 13 With React Server Components](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/03/internationalization-nextjs-13-react-server-components/): Server Components will have a big impact on the way we translate our React apps, especially on performance, code splitting and bundle size. This article introduces the topic well. I give some more extra details in this [thread](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/status/1638528549056311297).
- 📜 [Hooks You Probably Don't Need](https://reacttraining.com/blog/hooks-you-probably-dont-need): presentation of the lesser known hooks of React, classified by chance to need them (hello `useInsertionEffect` 😅). I liked the last section presenting a common anti-pattern and how `useLayoutEffect` prevents it. I think [useSyncExternalStore is great](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/status/1615329010761842689) for reading browser APIs such as `localStorage`.
- 📜 [Front-Commerce is getting a Remix](https://developers.front-commerce.com/changelog/front-commerce-is-getting-a-remix): after Shopify, it is now Front-Commerce that decides to base itself on Remix. This has many advantages, such as the possibility of using progressive enhancement, an MPA mode, and being less coupled to React.

**[Build and Run Synthetic Monitoring That Scales](https://www.checklyhq.com/product/monitoring-as-code/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=this-week-in-react)**

You build it, you own it! It’s a simple mantra that has driven software development for years. But what is the best way to monitor complex React applications?

First: Use Playwright to simulate critical user flows and guarantee that your app works. Second: Be confident that mission-critical APIs are up and running.

Monitoring as code is a new way to define, test, and deploy entire Playwright-based testing and monitoring setup directly from code. Get started with the Checkly CLI by running npm create @checkly/cli.

Learn more about the Checkly CLI [here](https://www.checklyhq.com/docs/cli/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=this-week-in-react).
