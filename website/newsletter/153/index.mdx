Hi everyone!

It looks like not everyone is on holiday: there's still plenty of news this week, both on the React and React-Native fronts.

I've got a question for you (you can email me back): would you prefer me to put direct links, or links to tweets?

- direct: 1-click access to the resource
- tweet: read related conversations

Stream is the maker of enterprise-grade **APIs** and **SDKs** that help product and engineering teams solve two common problems at scale: in-app chat and social activity feeds.

With Stream, developers can integrate any type of messaging or feed experience into their app in a fraction of the time it would take to build these features from scratch. Stream Chat makes it easy for developers to integrate rich, real-time messaging into their applications.

Stream provides robust client-side SDKs for popular frameworks such as [**React**](https://getstream.io/chat/sdk/react/?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=sponsorship&utm_content=&utm_campaign=thisweekinreact_July2023_video_klmh22), [**React-Native**](https://getstream.io/chat/sdk/react-native/?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=sponsorship&utm_content=&utm_campaign=thisweekinreact_July2023_video_klmh22), Expo, Flutter, Android, Angular, Compose, Unreal, and iOS.

## ⚛️ React {#react}

[![Astro 2.9](/emails/issues/153/astro.jpg)](https://astro.build/blog/astro-290/)

[**Astro 2.9**](https://astro.build/blog/astro-290/)

A new version of Astro has just been released with a long-awaited experimental feature: [View Transitions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/view-transitions/). This makes it easy to create fluid, animated transitions between HTML pages, without having to resort to client-side routing: there's no need for a `<Link>` component as with Next.js or Remix. For a React developer, this makes the framework more appealing and competitive in terms of UX compared with the classic SPA mode we're used to, while keeping a model simpler. Careful: these transitions won't preserve your React state across navigation, which could be a problem. Note [support View Transitions](https://caniuse.com/?search=View%20Transition%20API) remains weak, but is making rapid progress and can be considered as a progressive enhancement, plus Astro offers a fallback mode.

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

[![Solito 4](/emails/issues/153/solito4.jpg)](https://github.com/nandorojo/solito/releases/tag/v4.0.0)

[**Solito 4**](https://github.com/nandorojo/solito/releases/tag/v4.0.0)

New version of the project that unifies React-Native and Next.js under shared abstractions. With v4, it is now possible to use Next.js App Router. New APIs have been introduced for this purpose. Note that React-Native does not yet support React-Server Components: it is still a bit early to be able to use them in a cross-platform way.
