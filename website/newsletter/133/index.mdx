Hi everyone!

This year, I would like to make the newsletter a little more digestible. Do you have any suggestions for me? Do you think I put too many links and some can be deleted? Or do you like the exhaustive side? My goal is to make this newsletter less time consuming to write so that I can offer you more interesting content, like original articles. I'll explain it all to you soon.

If you are into Docusaurus, I was recently invited to the [Semaphore podcast to talk about it](https://semaphoreci.com/blog/sebastien-lorber-docusaurus).

Check out **[CSS Animation Weekly](https://weekly.cssanimation.rocks/?utm_source=thisweekinreact)**, a great resource for creative CSS developers looking for cool inspiration.

**[Extensible JavaScript libraries for surveys and forms](https://surveyjs.io/)**

[SurveyJS](https://github.com/surveyjs) is a set of open-source JavaScript form libraries that you can easily integrate into your web app. It lets you **create and run multiple forms**, retaining all sensitive data on your servers, or have **your own self-hosted WYSIWYG form builder** that non-tech users can use directly.

You can also **analyze survey results** in custom-built dashboards, save your forms to PDF, or simply **convert them to editable PDF files**. It offers native support for **React and Angular rendering** and total freedom of choice as to the backend, because **any server + database combination is fully compatible**.
