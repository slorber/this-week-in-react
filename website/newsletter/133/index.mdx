Hi everyone!

This year, I would like to make the newsletter a little more digestible. Do you have any suggestions for me? Do you think I put too many links and some can be deleted? Or do you like the exhaustive side? My goal is to make this newsletter less time consuming to write so that I can offer you more interesting content, like original articles. I'll explain it all to you soon.

If you are into Docusaurus, I was recently invited to the [Semaphore podcast to talk about it](https://semaphoreci.com/blog/sebastien-lorber-docusaurus).

Check out **[CSS Animation Weekly](https://weekly.cssanimation.rocks/?utm_source=thisweekinreact)**, a great resource for creative CSS developers looking for cool inspiration.

[![Astro rendering v2](/emails/issues/133/astro-rendering.jpg)](https://astro.build/blog/hybrid-rendering/)

**[Astro - Unlock New Possibilities with Hybrid Rendering](https://astro.build/blog/hybrid-rendering/)**

With Astro 1, you had to make a global choice for the whole site: 100% static (SSG) or 100% server (SSR). With Astro 2.0 it is now possible to choose for each page. The article details the internal workings of the Astro build, and how it had to evolve to support this new feature. They use static analysis to separate static routes from SSR routes.

[![Why React isn't dying](/emails/issues/133/reactisntdying.jpg)](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/why-react-isnt-dying)

**[Why React isn't dying](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/why-react-isnt-dying)**

Dominik explains why React is not about to die. React popularized JSX and the concept of component and declarative UI. The alternatives take the good parts and try to solve the problems, but it will be difficult to challenge it given the size of its ecosystem and its community that only gets stronger with time. It would take a big breakthrough innovation. Framework agnostic libraries (TanStack) have a role to play and allow to transfer knowledge from one ecosystem to another.

[![Resumable React: How To Use React Inside Qwik](/emails/issues/133/qwik.jpg)](https://www.builder.io/blog/resumable-react-how-to-use-react-inside-qwik)

**[Resumable React: How To Use React Inside Qwik](https://www.builder.io/blog/resumable-react-how-to-use-react-inside-qwik)**

This article highlights the integration between Qwik and React. Qwik is an innovative framework in beta, based on resumability rather than hydration. It exposes a method `qwikify$()` that allows to adapt an existing React component to be used in a Qwik app, with several possible hydration modes. To reduce the size of the bundle as much as possible, it is possible to avoid hydrating the React component and to use the native DOM events directly.

- 💬 [Replace Create React App recommendation with Vite - Dan Abramov answers](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/pull/5487#issuecomment-1409720741): long comment from Dan. Tells the CRA story, goal, and future with 5 possible options. TLDR: they don't want to deprecate CRA but don't want to recommend it either: depriving yourself of SSG/SSR is not a good thing. It is possible that the CRA CLI will become a launcher that offers a choice between several popular frameworks: Next.js, Remix, CRA...
