**[Vercel OG Image Generation: Fast, dynamic social card images at the Edge](https://vercel.com/blog/introducing-vercel-og-image-generation-fast-dynamic-social-card-images)**

Vercel presents a new very efficient solution to generate dynamic social cards in Vercel Edge Functions. Practical: it is possible to use JSX, React components (stateless) and Tailwind without additional config. I recommend [this thread](https://twitter.com/shuding_/status/1579607964549513217) explaining how it all works, very interesting! They even use Yoga, the layout engine from React-Native 🤭

**[The future of rendering in React](https://prateeksurana.me/blog/future-of-rendering-in-react/)**

Well-illustrated article that presents the rendering patterns of React 18 and above. You will find information about how SSR streaming works, Suspense, React lazy, feature flags implementation with Server Components...

**[Overcoming Popular Issues With React Projects](https://dinosaurs-with-jetpacks.com/posts/react-problems)**

Encourages to decouple our JavaScript apps from the framework (React or other). Promotes a return to more simplicity. Some hot takes that will probably not agree with.

**[Material UI in Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/blog/material-ui-in-storybook/)**

Tutorial with a particularly interesting section that explains how to automate the creation of Storytook controls by reusing the TypeScript types of the underlying UI library. Very useful when forwarding props. Even supports helpers like `Pick` and `Omit`.
