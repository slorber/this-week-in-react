Hi everyone, [Seb](https://x.com/sebastienlorber) here\! 👋

It's been another quiet week in the ecosystem, probably because everyone was afraid to announce anything during the massive Cloudflare outage\! By the way, this one was not caused by `useEffect` 😆!

We have a good variety of interesting links, but I’m not sure what could be the headline. The most important news was probably the announcement of the upcoming CSS grid support in Yoga and React Native, but it’s still a draft PR for now. Also excited by the TC39 proposals progressing.

Make sure to take the [State of React 2025 survey](https://survey.devographics.com/en-US/survey/state-of-react/2025?source=thisweekinreact.com), which just opened today\!
