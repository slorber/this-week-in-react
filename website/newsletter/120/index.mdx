Hi everyone!

The newsletter is late: a new React RFC gave me a lot of reading 😄 The article by Kent C. Dodds is quite long as well but worth it. We've got 2 articles highlighting Sandpack in 2 weeks, it's probably worth looking into!

It's moving well on the React-Native core side too, with new open discussions. We could even think that after the migration to the new architecture and the stabilization of public APIs, there could be a 1.0 release? It doesn't matter much in practice, but some apparently care deeply about having a major version.

There are also quite a few interesting new things in the frontend ecosystem. I'm particularly interested in Codeflow, Fontaine and Unplugin which may be of direct interest to Docusaurus.

Speaking of Docusaurus, I was invited to talk about it in the [Changelog JS Party podcast](https://changelog.com/jsparty/247).

[![Sizzy - the browser for developers](/emails/issues/120/sizzy.jpg)](https://sizzy.co/?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_source=thisweekinreact)

How come professionals in every other industry have specialized tools, but web developers are still stuck using the browser that their grandma is using for shopping on Amazon?

If you're opening localhost:3000 in any other browser except Sizzy, you're wasting hours of your precious time.

**Before Sizzy:** web development is stressing you out, responsive design is hard, you have an overwhelming amount of opened tabs and apps.

**After Sizzy:** all the tools you need are in one place, responsive design is a breeze, no more context switching.

You can [download it here](https://sizzy.co/?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_source=thisweekinreact) and try it for free for 14 days!

## ⚛️ React {#react}

**[React RFC: First class support for promises and async/await](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/229)**

The React team decided to go back to an `async/await` model to simplify the use of Server Components. Problem: it is difficult to support `async/await` on Client Components. So they propose to introduce a `use(promise)` API on the client side. Unlike other hooks, `use` can be called conditionally. Later it could be used with other "usables" like the React context (in reality, you can already [use `useContext` conditionally!](https://twitter.com/acdlite/status/1581401077915975680)). Using different APIs can also be seen as a feature: it allows to distinguish Server Components from Client Components.

This RFC gives rise to interesting debates. We wonder what the integration with data-fetching libraries will look like. The use of generators seems to be suitable for this case, but they are difficult to use in practice. We are waiting for a new RFC that will introduce a cache API.

**[The Web’s Next Transition](https://www.epicweb.dev/the-webs-next-transition)**

Kent C. Dodds offers a nice retrospective of the 3 main web architectures, very well illustrated and documented. He highlights the latest architecture, the trend of the moment: Progressively Enhanced Single-Page-Application. Remix is an implementation of this, with well thought abstractions that encourage to emulate the native behavior of the browser. I don't really agree that a server is absolutely necessary. [Docusaurus](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus) is also a PESPA implementation that works well without JavaScript.

**[A World-Class Code Playground with Sandpack](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/next-level-playground/)**

Josh Comeau praises [Sandpack](https://github.com/codesandbox/sandpack), the CodeSandbox toolkit he uses to create interactive code playgrounds. It looks easy to use and very flexible!

- 📜 [Streaming: is it worth it?](https://www.builder.io/blog/streaming-is-it-worth-it): the authors of Qwik, Solid and Marko explain the advantages of streaming, and why it is difficult to adopt this technique. In a React context, the libraries used (Helmet, CSS-in-JS, Redux...) must be compatible for streaming to be effective.
- 📜 [Storybook - First-class Vite support](https://storybook.js.org/blog/first-class-vite-support-in-storybook/): 7.0 will soon be in beta: support for Vite without config, pre-bundling, no more need for Webpack, support for new ones like Vue 2, Lit and Svelte...

We are in a Python backend context, their conclusions would probably be different in a JavaScript context where all devs are full-stack. The JS dev did the POC and lost his job afterwards 😅.

## 🔀 Other {#other}

**[StackBlitz Codeflow](https://stackblitz.com/codeflow)**

The StackBlitz [WebContainers](https://blog.stackblitz.com/posts/introducing-webcontainers/) technology allows to run Node.js in the browser via WebAssembly. You can run VS Code, Next.js or Docusaurus directly in your browser, and not via a remote Docker container. Codeflow adds the whole layer of integration with GitHub that makes it easy to open, review or edit a pull-request by running it locally in a secure way: extremely useful for open-source projects.

They also launched Web Publisher, a simplified editing view for Markdown files (editor, preview, save button). Very handy for contributing to documentation on Git, even for less technical users. There is a real preview of the content, and not the degraded experience of the GitHub Markdown preview. This is an [important need for Docusaurus users](https://twitter.com/ericsimons40/status/1580371754974781440).

**[Fontaine - Automatic font fallback based on font metrics](https://github.com/unjs/fontaine)**

Permits to avoid layout shifts when loading a custom font. Makes the fallback font the same size as the final font, so that the transition is smooth and does not impact the size of the text containers. Great idea!
