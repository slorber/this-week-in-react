Hi everyone!

Wondering why the newsletter is late this week?

Well, we had good reasons\!  
React v19.2 has just been released with the highly anticipated `<Activity>` component, `useEffectEvent` hook, and more\!

React Native also had exciting updates with an OS from Amazon with first-class React Native support, and upcoming solutions to integrate even more tightly with native platforms.

Don't forget that React Conf starts next week, on October 7\. The [schedule](https://conf.react.dev/agenda) is online, full of interesting talks, and we can expect more exciting announcements\!

## ⚛️ React {#react}

React 19.2  
[https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/pull/8028](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/pull/8028)

- `<Activity>` is to me the most exciting feature. It can hide a React subtree and unmount its effects while preserving its state, and keep rendering it with lower priority. It unlocks very exciting pre-rendering patterns along the way\! More Activity modes are coming.
- `useEffectEvent(callback)` always sees the latest props and state, helping avoid the stale closure problem. Effect Events should only be called from `useEffect()` and can be omitted in the dependency array.
- `cacheSignal()` returns a signal that triggers when `React.cache()` lifetime is over, letting you abort tasks in RSCs.
- Performance Tracks helps you profile your app in Chrome DevTools. The Scheduler track shows React splits your code into different priorities. The Component track shows when a component renders and how long it takes.
- `resume()` enables you to implement Partial Pre-Rendering. You can now pre-render the static parts of your app at build time, then resume rendering to complete the dynamic parts.
- `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` v6 with flat config by default and opt-in for React Compiler powered rules.
