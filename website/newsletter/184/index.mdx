**[Omlet — a new component analytics tool for React 🔎](https://omlet.dev/?utm_campaign=partner_this-week-in-react_second-sponsor-may-2024)**

Too many custom or outdated components, not enough reuse? Not with Omlet. Omlet scans your codebase and instantly provides pre-built and custom charts on:

- Unused and deprecated components to remove
- Similar or redundant components to consolidate
- Recently created components that indicate emerging patterns
- Component dependencies so you can estimate and visualize the impact of code updates

With this data, you can stop guessing which components to keep, remove, or improve — and maintain a healthier codebase and more simplified libraries. [Try Omlet free for 30 days](https://omlet.dev/?utm_campaign=partner_this-week-in-react_second-sponsor-may-2024).
