Hi everyone!

We're back after a short break, covering two weeks of news!

I hope you have recovered well from the React 19 beta release 😄 But it's not over, we are entering an exciting period with React Conf, Vercel Ship, App.js and many other conferences just around the corner.

This week, React patching globals was a hot topic in the ecosystem. We also had a few interesting React-related releases, including 2 major headless libraries.

As expected, Expo SDK 51 is out, and it looks like it's a good time to try out the New Architecture.

This [workaround](https://www.propelauth.com/post/getting-url-in-next-server-components) made me smile: putting request data in a header through a middleware to be able to access it.

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

This section is authored by [Benedikt](https://twitter.com/bndkt).

[![Expo SDK 51](/emails/issues/184/expo51.jpg)](https://expo.dev/changelog/2024/05-07-sdk-51)

[**Expo SDK 51**](https://expo.dev/changelog/2024/05-07-sdk-51)

Hot on the heels of React Native 0.74 follows the release of Expo SDK 51. This release mostly advances the internal architecture and promotes some previously experimental packages to the new default, so let me quickly get out of the way the topics we have already covered in this newsletter: New Architecture support for most Expo modules (there are still some [known issues](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/new-architecture/#known-issues-in-expo-sdk-libraries)), Bridgeless support, support for Apple’s privacy manifest, “next” versions of camera and sqlite package are now the default, Fingerprint no longer experimental. But there is also a new expo-symbols package featuring Apple’s SF Symbols library (iOS only), a new expo-video library, Expo Router 3.5 release with support for the # segment in URLs, and improvements to EAS Update (e.g. a web UI to roll out updates gradually). I expect bigger announcements around Expo Router (RSC 👀) at the upcoming React Conf, so stay tuned! One other significant change is that Expo Go, starting with version 51, only supports one single version of the Expo SDK. This decision makes absolute sense to me as it makes maintenance of the Expo Go app a lot easier and for most use cases, you should be using Expo Dev Client anyways.
