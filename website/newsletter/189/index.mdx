🎥 **[Ryan Florence talk “Mind the Gap”](https://www.youtube.com/live/1g5ruM-16_Y?t=7443s)**

I watched this talk after hearing multiple people describing it as one of the best tech conference talks they’ve ever seen. We’re at a very interesting point in time in web development, with React 19 bringing a major shift to the React model, new JS frameworks gaining popularity, and lots of online discussions drawing distinctions and/or making comparisons to Rails and Laravel. Ryan’s talk is a really good overview of how we got here and it offers, in my opinion, a very good mental model of how to think about React 19. Also fun to see one of the creators of Remix give a Next.js demo 😉
