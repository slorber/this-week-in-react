Hi everyone!

This week I found many React Core PRs to look at. Too many, in fact, so I've saved a few for next week!

After 2D with Skia, it's super excitings to see React Native devs exploring the 3D space!

[![React Docs - Add onCaughtError / onUncaughtError, improve onRecoverableError](/emails/issues/181/react-errors.jpg)](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/pull/6742)

[**React Docs - Add onCaughtError / onUncaughtError, improve onRecoverableError**](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/pull/6742)

Recently, the React core team overhauled the way errors are handled in React 19. Those improvements are available in React 19 canary releases and should probably land in Next.js 14.2+ sooner or later. This notably includes new public API callbacks available on the React Root (`createRoot`, `hydrateRoot`):

- `onCaughtError` 🆕 reports errors caught by error boundaries
- `onUncaughtError` 🆕 reports uncaught errors (duh)
- `onRecoverableError` now uses the ES Error Cause feature to report the original cause

The linked PR is the WIP documentation for those new APIs, including many interactive examples. The main motivation seems to be presenting an error dialog to the user.

What excited me most in all this is that it's the first time I'm able to see in action the brand-new React hydration error message displayed in a dialog, as shown in the screenshot above. This will greatly improve the DX of React!

This post presents the benefits of new keywords `component`, `hook`, and `renders` keywords introduced directly into the language, and presents great benefits in terms of DX, type-safety, and static analysis in general. I wish we had those in TypeScript too, but since it’s specific to React it’s unlikely to happen unless benefiting the whole JS ecosystem.

[![Refine - Open source Retool Alternative](/emails/issues/177/refine.jpg)](https://github.com/refinedev/refine)

**[Refine - Open source Retool Alternative](https://github.com/refinedev/refine)**

The sweet spot between the low code and traditional development for CRUD-heavy applications.

As an open-source React meta-framework designed for Enterprise applications, [Refine](https://github.com/refinedev/refine) offers a headless solution ideal for tasks like admin panels, dashboards, and internal tools.

While low-code tools may offer initial promise, they often fall short in handling complex scenarios due to scalability issues, limited customization options, and the risk of vendor lock-in.

Refine enables teams to rapidly develop production-ready apps while maintaining flexibility.

[![New 3D library for React Native in the works](/emails/issues/181/rn3d.jpg)](https://twitter.com/mrousavy/status/1775840325161853389)

🐦 [**New 3D library for React Native in the works**](https://twitter.com/mrousavy/status/1775840325161853389)

One of the most inspiring things in the RN community is observing folks like Marc Rousavy, William Candillon and Christian Falch pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with this technology and going far beyond rendering text and buttons on a screen. With the recent Skia announcements, we saw the state of the art regarding 2D rendering in RN. Now, Marc provided a sneak peek of some exciting advancements in 3D rendering with RN. Apparently, Margelo is working on a new library to enable access to the native Graphics APIs (Metal/Vulkan) from RN. Apart from the short [demo video](https://twitter.com/JPoliachik/status/1775866218743787934), I also found this [thread](https://twitter.com/mrousavy/status/1775870100945461277) very interesting, where Marc explains their approach using a C++ library and why they didn’t go with Three.js, which is amazing on web (React-Three-Fiber supports RN).
