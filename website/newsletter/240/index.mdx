Hi everyone!

Cyril and Matthieu from [Theodo Apps](https://apps.theodo.com/en?utm_source=thisweekinreact) here 👋.

This week in the React ecosystem, there's a bit of a stir around Radix and shadcn/ui. Some devs are weighing alternatives like Base UI, while shadcn highlights their long-term adaptability. We’ve also got fresh official guides from the Next.js team and some tooling updates like Vite 7, Apollo Client v4 RC, and Prettier 3.6’s fast CLI.

On the React Native side, the graphics game is leveling up fast with WebGPU and Skia Graphite unlocking smoother 2D/3D rendering and broader platform support. And if you’re into performance tricks, don’t miss how Reddit shaved 20% off their iOS app size.

Let's dive in!

[**The Future of React Native Graphics: WebGPU, Skia, and Beyond**](https://shopify.engineering/webgpu-skia-web-graphics)

WebGPU and Skia Graphite are transforming React Native by enabling unified GPU-powered graphics, seamless 2D/3D rendering, and out-of-the-box support for libraries like Three.js and TensorFlow.js. These advancements bring massive performance gains, simplify shader development with TSL (Three.js Shading Language), and expand platform support to macOS, tvOS, and Node.js. Kudos to William Candillon and the Shopify team for this groundbreaking work \!
