Hi everyone!

This week I'm excited about a promising new headless component library, and I've found various interesting articles about Web Components relevant to React developers.

On the mobile side, Google introduced Android XR and React Native support is already coming!

🎄 We are taking a Christmas break, this is the last newsletter until 8th January.\
🧑‍🎄 You've already given me a great gift, we are now 4th most popular JS newsletter according to the recently published [State of JS 2024 survey result](https://2024.stateofjs.com/en-US/resources/).

## ⚛️ React {#react}

[![Base UI 1.0 alpha](/emails/issues/214/base-ui.jpg)](https://base-ui.com/)

[**Base UI 1.0 alpha**](https://base-ui.com/)

I’m usually not into UI libs. But when Radix, MUI and Floating UI creators gather to create a new set of 25 unstyled, accessible, composable primitive components with great care to details, I think it’s worth paying attention\! Radix is super popular these days (notably thanks to shadcn/ui), but has been [less actively maintained](https://github.com/radix-ui/primitives/graphs/contributors) recently, and a new headless lib challenger is always welcome\!
