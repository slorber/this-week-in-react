Hi everyone!

This is another great React week.

Vercel has unveiled new super-interesting caching APIs for Next.js, and the React Native ecosystem is on fire!

On my side, I'm a bit tired of Twitter penalizing me for commenting external links. I'm giving Bluesky a try ([@sebastienlorber.com](https://bsky.app/profile/sebastienlorber.com)). Come say hi if you are there.

Don't forget to fill in the [State of React survey](https://survey.devographics.com/en-US/survey/state-of-react/2024?source=this_week_in_react), and mention that you read the newsletter 😇.

[![Next.js Conf 2024 Recap](/emails/issues/207/nextjsconf.jpg)](https://vercel.com/blog/recap-next-js-conf-2024)

[**Next.js Conf 2024 Recap**](https://vercel.com/blog/recap-next-js-conf-2024)

Last week, the community gathered at the Next.js conference. This recap is a nice overview of the highlights, including:

- Next.js 15 stable
- Turbopack Dev stable
- Simpler caching, reduced complexity
- Self-hosting improvements and templates

The sister blog post [Our Journey with Caching](https://nextjs.org/blog/our-journey-with-caching) is particularly interesting, introducing new experimental caching semantics and APIs such as `use cache`, `cacheTag`, and `cacheLife`. It’s a more flexible system, and super cool that you don’t even need to provide a cache key.

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

[![New Architecture by default, DevTools, and more](/emails/issues/207/newarch.jpg)](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2024/10/23/release-0.76-new-architecture)

[**React Native 0.76 \- New Architecture by default, DevTools, and more**](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2024/10/23/release-0.76-new-architecture)

React Native 0.76 is out with major updates\! The New Architecture is now enabled by default, there's a new React Native DevTools for improved debugging, and CSS support for `boxShadow` and `filter` for enhanced UI effects (available only with the new architecture). Be aware of some breaking changes: minimum SDK requirements have been raised to iOS 15.1 and Android SDK 24 (Android 7). Time to upgrade and check it out\!

v0.76 is cool, but what’s even better is that the [New Architecture is here](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2024/10/23/the-new-architecture-is-here) and officially declared ready to be used in production\! This is a multi-year effort and a huge milestone for the React Native ecosystem\! At this point, you probably already heard about JSI, Fabric, Turbomodules, synchronous low-overhead bridgeless communication, interop mode, and more. It’s not just about performance, but also solving important UX/DX problems such as being able to measure views synchronously to position a tooltip, or having `useLayoutEffect` work like on the web. What excites me most is also probably the most underrated: React Native can finally use React 18+ concurrent features, notably transitions, Suspense, and what’s coming next.
