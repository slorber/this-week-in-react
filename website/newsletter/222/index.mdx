Hi everyone!

This week we have 2 official blog posts from the React and React Native core teams! CRA is deprecated and React Native 0.78 is out with React 19 support.

🎂 We're also celebrating this newsletter's 5th anniversary! The [first issue](https://substack.thisweekinreact.com/p/react-hebdo-sebastien-lorber-1-20-02-13) went out on February 13th. For the first 2 years it was only in French. I’d love to know who's been reading since the early days—say hi if you have! 😀

[![Sunsetting Create React App](/emails/issues/222/cra.jpg)](https://react.dev/blog/2025/02/14/sunsetting-create-react-app)

**[Sunsetting Create React App](https://react.dev/blog/2025/02/14/sunsetting-create-react-app)**

Long overdue, CRA has received the latest React 19 fixes and is now officially deprecated. This article explains the limits of the CRA and build tools regarding routing, waterfalls, code splitting, and more. The React team encourages us to adopt a framework like Next.js, React Router, or Expo to address these issues. However, you can still [build a React app from scratch](https://react.dev/learn/build-a-react-app-from-scratch) using Vite, Parcel, Rsbuild, or other modern build tools.

The initial announcement sparked heated debates on X and GitHub, mainly because it overemphasized frameworks at the expense of build tools like Vite. It was [soon updated](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/pull/7624) to address these concerns. All this also led to potential collaboration opportunities between [Evan You (Vite) and the React team](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/31768#issuecomment-2666856223) to work together on an opinionated "official" way to integrate with Vite with React Server Components, with a commitment to maintain this integration over time in the React repository.

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

[![React Native 0.78 - React 19 and more](/emails/issues/222/rn.jpg)](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2025/02/19/react-native-0.78)

**[React Native 0.78 \- React 19 and more](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2025/02/19/react-native-0.78)**

I bet you weren't expecting a React Native release so soon, but the team recently decided to releases smaller versions more frequently. Here are the highlights:

- React 19 support\!
- Simplified process to enable the React Compiler.
- Metro log streaming is back in 0.78 and 0.77.1, but opt-in with a new `--client-logs` flag, and still deprecated.
- `<Image>` supports Android XML resources, unlocking possible perf improvements.
- `ReactNativeFactory` on iOS to ease brownfield usage in any ViewController

React 19 itself unlocks many cool things:

- Actions (async transitions), `useActionState()`, `useOptimistic()`, all useful to submit forms and manage loading, error, and optimistic state
- Use `ref` as a regular prop instead of `forwardRef()`, also supporting a ref cleanup function
- Use `<Context>` instead of `<Context.Provider>`
- Read contexts and promises with `use()`
