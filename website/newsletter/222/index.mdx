[React Native 0.78 \- React 19 and more](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2025/02/19/react-native-0.78)

I bet you weren't expecting a React Native release so soon, but the team recently decided to releases smaller versions more frequently. Here are the highlights:

- React 19 support\!
- Simplified process to enable the React Compiler.
- Metro log streaming is back in 0.78 and 0.77.1, but opt-in with a new `--client-logs` flag, and still deprecated.
- `<Image>` supports Android XML resources, unlocking possible perf improvements.
- `ReactNativeFactory` on iOS to ease brownfield usage in any ViewController

React 19 unlocks many cool things, including:

- Actions (async transitions), `useActionState()`, `useOptimistic()`, all useful to submit forms and manage loading, error, and optimistic state
- Use `ref` as a regular prop instead of `forwardRef()`, also supporting a ref cleanup function
- Use `<Context>` instead of `<Context.Provider>`
- Read contexts and promises with `use()`

- 📣 [Expo support for React Native 0.78](https://expo.dev/changelog/react-native-78): Due to the React 19 upgrade, v0.78 will not be supported in SDK52, but will be in the canary version. SDK 53 is scheduled for this spring and will likely upgrade directly to 0.79.
- 👀 [Gradle Plugin PR \- Add option to disable bundle compression](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/49449): Marc Rousavy proposing a `react.enableBundleCompression=true` property. Turning it off could greatly optimize Android app startup time, but increases the app install size.
- 💬 [Making the JitPack Repository optional](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/discussions/877): Android apps With v0.78, Android apps have a new `react.includeJitpackRepository=true` Gradle property. Turning it off could improve supply chain security, and may become the default in the future.
