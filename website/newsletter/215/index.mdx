- 👀 [React PR \- “Forgive” IDE extension](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/31918): The React Compiler team recently [hinted at React Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8Mg-NSyqWg&t=14452s) their intent to create a “React IDE” powered by the compiler, not limited to just linting but also providing educational tooltips and more. Well, there's nothing very interesting to see yet, but work has begun on scaffolding a Language Server Protocol and VSCode extension, driven by a new [reactrc config file](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/31916).

[Expo \- 2024 year in review](https://expo.dev/blog/2024-year-in-review)

To get 2025 off to a good start, let's recap all the great things Expo offered us last year:

- Expo SDKs v50, v51, v52
- Support for New Arch by default
- Expo Router v3, v4
- DOM components
- Fingerprinting
- Atlas & DevTools
- expo.new
- Workflows
- Environment variables, security activity, and audit logs

- 📜 [Static Hermes Update, Dec 2024](https://x.com/tmikov/status/1869945330638442651): Static Hermes is expected to roll out in 2025, initially opt-in, then enabled by default. It can compile and execute both typed and untyped code. Benchmarks show it’s already significantly faster on untyped code, particularly with JIT mode and when Hermes can infer some types. No benchmark was provided for typed code, but I guess it should be much faster\!
