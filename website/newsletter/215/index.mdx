Hi everyone!

We initially planned to return on 8th January.\
But here I am a little earlier, wishing you all a Happy New Year! 🎉\
With the end-of-year festivities, it's been a quiet week for React, as you'd expect.

I also take the opportunity to share a little newsletter retrospective, and thank you once again for reading the newsletter and making all this possible.

In 2024 the newsletter went from being a sustainable project to a break-even business. This allows me to invest more in the project and improve the content. Let's share some concrete figures from 2023 to 2024 :

- 📈 **Subscribers**: 31k ➡️ 46k - A great +15k subscribers increase this year. Not exponential as I expected, but still very nice!
- 👥 **Writers**: 1 ➡️ 4 - I'm no longer the sole writer of this curation newsletter: Benedikt, Matthieu and Cyril have backed me up when I was unavailable.
- 📨 **Issues**: 38 ➡️ 47 - Onboarding other writers allowed us to send out an email almost every week!
- 💰 **Income**: 47k€ ➡️ 99k€ ARR - We are getting good as sales, and have successfully convinced most companies we wanted to work with to sponsor us.
- 💸 **Charges**: 15k€ ➡️ 36k€ - We have increased our charges significantly this year by onboarding guest newsletter writers (14k€). The other charges are ads (12k€), SaaS (7k€) and virtual assistants (3k€).

Overall I think it has been a great 2024 year, looking forward to a promising future. I didn't reach my ambitious goal of 50k subscribers, but I'm not too far. After the summer, it became more challenging to grow, not sure why. I still reached another important symbolic milestone: having more newsletter subscribers than Twitter followers, becoming less dependent of social platforms.

In 2025, I'd like the newsletter to be more than just a list of curation emails. I plan to onboard guest writers, paying them to produce a series of articles on topics they are passionate about. If you think you'd be a great fit, reply and say hi! 👋

If you'd like to help me realize my plans, please share the newsletter with a friend or colleague who might enjoy it, or on any social platform.

It can compile and execute both typed and untyped code. Benchmarks show it’s already significantly faster on untyped code, particularly with JIT mode when Hermes can infer types. No benchmark was provided for typed code, but we can expect it to be much faster\! The improved ES compliance will also permit to remove heavy Babel plugins. TLDR: in 2025 you can expect a great speed increase of both build and runtime.
