**[Visual testing for Storybook, Playwright & Cypress](https://www.chromatic.com/features/visual-test?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=2nd_sponsor&utm_campaign=q3_2024)**

Tired of broken layouts and janky UI slowing you down? Chromatic’s visual tests allow you to build with confidence. They catch bugs that functional tests miss, from misaligned elements to incorrect colors and z-index glitches.

No need for separate test cases or configuration. Chromatic plugs into your existing setup for Storybook, Playwright, or Cypress to enable visual testing of your application's UI. All tests run in parallel — at no extra cost — powered by Chromatic’s lightning-fast Capture Cloud infrastructure.

Setup takes just two minutes, and our base plan includes 5,000 free snapshots per month. [Get started today »](https://www.chromatic.com/features/visual-test?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=2nd_sponsor&utm_campaign=q3_2024)
