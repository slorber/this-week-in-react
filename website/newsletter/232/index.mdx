**[Bit: Celebrating 10 Years of Composability](https://bit.cloud/?utm_source=ThisWeekInReact&utm_id=551)**

For a decade, we navigated the complexities of disconnected systems, facing integration headaches and scaling challenges. Our journey to build effectively at scale led us to a breakthrough: [**Harmony**](https://bit.dev/blog/meet-harmony-a-practical-solution-for-composability/).  
  
Discover our 10-year story of pioneering composable architecture and how Harmony finally delivered the monolithic simplicity and distributed power we always envisioned, transforming our development from struggle to exponential progress.
