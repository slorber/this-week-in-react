Hi everyone!

It was [Jamstack Conf](https://jamstack.org/conf/) this week, and we had some nice announcements for the occasion, like Tanstack Router, Gatsby 5 or the results of their annual survey.

Expo released its superb SDK 47. The 1st release-candidate React-Native 0.71 leads to some Android build issues 😅.

Next.js and React-Native now both use TypeScript by default on new apps.

Last chance to buy the [Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/) course with the promo code [TWIR](https://threejs-journey.com/join/TWIR) (-30%, expires tomorrow). It has just been [upgraded](https://twitter.com/bruno_simon/status/1585222892769497089) with 24 hours of React-Three-Fiber modules. I take this opportunity to highlight [Maxime Heckel's blog](https://blog.maximeheckel.com/) who took the course last year and is now able to do some pretty cool 3D! He has just published an impressive [article on particles](https://blog.maximeheckel.com/posts/the-magical-world-of-particles-with-react-three-fiber-and-shaders/).

If you're opening localhost:3000 in any other browser except Sizzy, you're wasting hours of your precious time.

**Before Sizzy:** web development is stressing you out, responsive design is hard, you have an overwhelming amount of opened tabs and apps.

## ⚛️ React {#react}

[![TanStack Router](/emails/issues/123/tanstack-router.png)](https://tanstack.com/router/v1)

**[TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/v1)**

Tanner unveils his new project: a 100% typesafe, framework-agnostic router. An impressive list of features, including:

- URL State Management
- Built-in Caching
- Search Param Schema/Validation
- Auto Prefetching
- Loaders/Actions
- Async Elements + Code-Splitting

At first glance, it looks like there is some inspiration from Remix or React-Router, but the API is quite different and not based on JSX, which probably help to make the solution agnostic and typesafe. For now there is only the React adapter, and the doc is incomplete, but it looks quite promising!

[![Gatsby 5: The Fastest Gatsby Yet](/emails/issues/123/gatsby5.png)](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/gatsby-5/)

**[Gatsby 5: The Fastest Gatsby Yet](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/gatsby-5/)**

Gatsby 5.0 has just been officially released. It includes the Gatsby Slice API which allows to improve the build time when modifying a layout element (header, footer...), and the support in beta of the Server Components which allow partial hydration. There are also new Head/Script components, GraphiQL v2, and more.

Gatsby also presented [Valhalla](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/products/valhalla-content-hub/), a new service on their cloud that proposes to use Gatsby source plugins to create a content hub and a unified GraphQL API decoupled, from Gatsby. It is [possible to use Valhalla with Next.js](<https://github.com/gatsby-inc/valhalla-examples/blob/main/frameworks/nextjs/app/(pets)/page.tsx>).

Static site generators are not very popular at the moment, despite still being suitable for many sites, I think it's good that at least one big player continues to innovate in the field. The Slice API looks like a good idea. I wish Valhalla could run locally, but I think it's a cloud service only.

[![React Router-ing Remix](/emails/issues/123/reactroutering.png)](https://remix.run/blog/react-routering-remix)

**[React Router-ing Remix](https://remix.run/blog/react-routering-remix)**

Many Remix data APIs have been added in React-Router 6.4, and much more. Now it's Remix's turn to officially rely on these new React-Router APIs. The upgrade will be done in 4 incremental and backwards compatible steps delivered in Remix v1.x with feature flags. The vision is to make Remix v2 a compiler for React-Router 6.4.

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

[![Expo SDK 47](/emails/issues/123/expo47.png)](https://blog.expo.dev/expo-sdk-47-a0f6f5c038af)

**[Expo SDK 47](https://blog.expo.dev/expo-sdk-47-a0f6f5c038af)**

The new SDK 47 has just been officially released, with a more detailed article on what's new.

- React Native 0.70.5 and React 18.1.0
- Expo Modules API 1.0 allows to create very easily native Fabric modules in Swift/Kotlin
- Hermes available on Expo Go iOS, simplified debugging experience. Hermes will be the default engine in the next SDK
- Fabric support in several Expo modules
- Expo Router in beta: file-system routing for React-Navigation
- Various EAS improvements: end-to-end security, M1 workers...

In short, a very nice release! With Expo Modules, it seems easier to adopt the new architecture compared to official tools like react-native-codegen which doesn't support Swift yet.
