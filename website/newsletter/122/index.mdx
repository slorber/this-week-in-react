How come professionals in every other industry have specialized tools, but web developers are still stuck using the browser that their grandma is using for shopping on Amazon?

If you're opening localhost:3000 in any other browser except Sizzy, you're wasting hours of your precious time.

**Before Sizzy:** web development is stressing you out, responsive design is hard, you have an overwhelming amount of opened tabs and apps.

**After Sizzy:** all the tools you need are in one place, responsive design is a breeze, no more context switching.

You can [download it here](https://sizzy.co/?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_source=thisweekinreact) and try it for free for 14 days!
