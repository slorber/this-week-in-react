Hi everyone!

It's been a fairly quiet week compared with the previous one, and I couldn't pick any headliner!

The most important news for our ecosystem is probably the official deprecation of Create React App. There's also Tailwind v4 and Standard Schema v1.

I'm quite excited by the upcoming TypeScript 5.8 `erasableSyntaxOnly` flag that forbids usage of features such as enums. This is the path toward making your app compatible Node.js built-in support, and maybe browsers too in the future.
