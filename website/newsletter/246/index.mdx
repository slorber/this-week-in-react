Hi everyone! **Kacper and Krzysztof from [Software Mansion](https://swmansion.com/?utm_source=thisweekinreact)** here! 👋

After a short summer break we’re happy to say we’re back\! I think we could open a public swimming pool because we’re drowning in the amount of content this week.

This week was full of big releases: Vercel released Next.js 15.5, React Native 0.81 was launched, and last but not least, we finally have the long-awaited Flashlist 2 with great performance and cool features.

So let’s get into it\!

- `runtime: “nodejs”` in middleware now marked as stable  
- Turbopack for production builds in beta  
- Typed Routes for type-safe navigation  
- Deprecation of `next lint` in order to provide Biome as a fast alternative to ESLint

[![FlashList v2: A Ground-Up Rewrite for React Native's New Architecture](/emails/issues/246/flashlist-banner.jpg)](https://shopify.engineering/flashlist-v2)

**[FlashList v2: A Ground-Up Rewrite for React Native's New Architecture](https://shopify.engineering/flashlist-v2)**

FlashList v2 is a complete rewrite that eliminates the need for developers to provide item size estimates, a major limitation of v1. Thanks to React Native's New Architecture, which enables synchronous layout measurements, FlashList v2 can precisely calculate and correct item positions before they are painted on the screen. This new approach removes the need for native code and delivers pixel-perfect scrolling, improves performance with an adaptive rendering algorithm, and enables advanced features like automatic scroll position maintenance. Also, FlashList v2 comes with masonry layout support built-in.

[![React Native 0.81 - Android 16 support, faster iOS builds, and more](/emails/issues/246/rn-banner.jpg)](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2025/08/12/react-native-0.81)

**[React Native 0.81 - Android 16 support, faster iOS builds, and more](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2025/08/12/react-native-0.81)**

React Native version 0.81 introduces support for the new Android 16, which enforces `edge-to-edge` display requirements. A major new experimental feature is precompiled builds for iOS, promising significantly faster compilation times. Since this version the built-in `<SafeAreaView>` component is deprecated and they moved JSC runtime support out to a community-maintained package.
