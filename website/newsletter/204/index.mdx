Hi everyone!

It's been another exciting week with great React cross-platform announcements at the Meta Connect event giving positive feedback on the usage of React Compiler, StyleX, React Strict DOM, and Hermes. I'm also excited for the React Compiler to add official support for React 18 and React 17 (experimental).

On the React Native side, we also had great releases and announcements, notably a new cross-platform framework from the Tamagui team, Zeego 2, native bottom tabs, and RN Storybook 8.

In the frontend world, Deno 2.0 just came out, and we also have a very exciting TC39 meeting happening right now.

Happy reading!

[**React at Meta Connect 2024**](https://engineering.fb.com/2024/10/02/android/react-at-meta-connect-2024/)

At a recent event, Meta announced:

- New Instagram and Facebook mixed-reality apps for the Meta Quest headset. These apps use React Native and run on Static Hermes. The team was able to reuse existing Facebook web code and infrastructure thanks to technologies such as StyleX and React Strict DOM.
- A new Meta Horizon RN app that performs on par with their main native Facebook app. They mention the render-as-you-fetch pattern as the most impactful performance improvement they implemented.
- Meta Horizon Store for web/mobile/HorizonOS built using the bleeding-edge React Compiler, StyleX, React Strict DOM
- Meta Spatial Editor built on top of React Native Windows/macOS enables them to integrate natively their custom 3D rendering engine. The C++/Qt team was initially skeptical but ended up loving Fast Refresh.

Many great innovative projects are being dogfooded at Meta on real production apps, improving the framework and ecosystem for all of us along the way, for all platforms. With all this, we can confidently claim that Meta will continue to bet on React as an excellent cross-platform solution for the years to come.

RSC support will come later once React 19 and Vite Environment API are ready.

Nate, the creator of Tamagui, released a new universal framework that supports web and mobile. It’s built on top of Vite instead of Metro, has universal typed file-based routing, Remix-like loaders, and various render modes (SSG/SSR/SPA). It also helps you build local-first apps with an opt-in integration with the granular Zero sync engine.
