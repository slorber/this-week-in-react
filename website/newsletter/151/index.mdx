[![RBreaking Up with SVG-in-JS in 2023](/emails/issues/151/svginjs.jpg)](https://kurtextrem.de/posts/svg-in-js)

**[Breaking Up with SVG-in-JS in 2023](https://kurtextrem.de/posts/svg-in-js)**

Very comprehensive article on the various ways of using SVGs in a React app, and their impact on performance.
Advises against "SVG-in-JS": you should avoid rendering SVG markup via React components and having the SVG code be present in the JS bundle, including via solutions such as the SVGR loader. With a few exceptions, it's best to avoid inlining SVGs in HTML: React Server Components aren't necessarily an ideal solution either. SVG sprites are a good solution.

[![Reinventing Camera Processing - TensorFlow Lite GPU straight from JavaScript](/emails/issues/151/visioncamera.jpg)](https://mrousavy.com/blog/Reinventing-Camera-Processing)

**[Reinventing Camera Processing - TensorFlow Lite GPU straight from JavaScript](https://mrousavy.com/blog/Reinventing-Camera-Processing)**

Marc Rousavy explains how he is able to run TensorFlow models on React-Native Vision Camera v3 ([demo](https://twitter.com/mrousavy/status/1674791891823648770)). His plugin has just been open-sourced in [VisionCamera v3 rc.3](https://twitter.com/mrousavy/status/1675883155822202880). The article is fairly technical, explaining how it works internally to run at 60+ FPS. TLDR: it's now very easy to integrate a TensorFlow model into Vision Camera, and draw some real-time feedback via React-Native-Skia. There's no need to write native code, and all this logic can even be deployed via Over-The-Air updates!
