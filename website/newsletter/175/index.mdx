Hi everyone!

This week has been rather quiet in terms of releases, but we have many great articles to read!

Sorry for last week, the email was so long that despite removing links, it got truncated by Gmail 😅.

[![Instant Search Params with React Server Components](/emails/issues/175/next-search.jpg)](https://buildui.com/posts/instant-search-params-with-react-server-components)

**[Instant Search Params with React Server Components](https://buildui.com/posts/instant-search-params-with-react-server-components)**

An awesome interactive article showing that it’s surprisingly hard to persist UI state to the query string in a React Server Component world and yet give immediate user feedback. Updating the URL triggers a server round-trip. The new `useOptimistic` hook solves this problem nicely. This also shows a nice use-case for CSS `:has()`, to avoid hoisting the `startTransition` pending state.

[![Building a React Metaframework with Vinxi](/emails/issues/175/vinxi.jpg)](https://www.brenelz.com/posts/building-a-react-metaframework-with-vinxi/)

**[Building a React Metaframework with Vinxi](https://www.brenelz.com/posts/building-a-react-metaframework-with-vinxi/)**

TIL about [Vinxi](https://vinxi.vercel.app/), a toolbox built on top of Vite and Nitro enabling you to easily create your own meta-framework, with support, SSR, routing conventions, server functions and everything. Solid Start uses it behind the hood, but it’s a framework-agnostic SDK. Apparently, [TanStack Start will use it too](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/status/1762809340719780080)! This article explains how to use it with React.

- 📜 [Avoiding Hydration Mismatches with useSyncExternalStore](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/avoiding-hydration-mismatches-with-use-sync-external-store): Another great article from Dominik explaining how `useSyncExternalStore` and its 2 client/server snapshot callbacks can help prevent hydration mismatches. It can be a better alternative to useEffect for many use-cases, including rendering localized dates, or creating a client-only wrapper component.
- 📜 [Exploring Next.js Forms with Server Actions](https://www.robinwieruch.de/next-forms/): A very comprehensive step-by-step tutorial on using the new React/Next.js form primitives without any abstractions, and all the little mistakes you might make along the way.
- 📜 [No Outer margin](https://kyleshevlin.com/no-outer-margin/): Gives good reasons to not apply margins inside your component root, but instead let the parent component handle the layout. Margins are the first thing that come to mind, but there are also other CSS rules that break component encapsulation. I recovered a great deleted article for you on that matter: [Layout-isolated components](https://web.archive.org/web/20201024040746/https://visly.app/blog/layout-isolated-components).
- 📜 [Vjeux - 12 Years at Meta](https://blog.vjeux.com/2024/project/12-years-at-meta.html): If you are a new React developer, you may not have heard of Christopher Chedeau, but he’s one of the most impactful member of our community. A few things he created or significantly contributed to: React, React Native, Yoga, CSS-in-JS, Prettier, Excalidraw, Docusaurus, GraphQL…
- 📜 [Learning Four Key Primitives In Solid](https://www.brenelz.com/posts/learning-four-key-primitives-in-solid/): Don’t be mislead by the title, it’s a great article for React devs, comparing Solid vs React, Next.js and Remix on 4 interesting topics. TIL that Next.js RSC components would waterfall by default unless you use a preloading function.
- 📜 [Handle both JSON and FormData in Remix](https://www.jacobparis.com/content/conform-json-formdata): Jacob explains the tradeoffs of using form inputs vs creating a FormData or JSON payload manually on an event handler. Shows how to create an Remix abstraction using Zod and Conform that can conveniently accept both JSON and FormData paylods.

- 📜 [HTMX vs React - A Complete Comparison](https://semaphoreci.com/blog/htmx-react): The article suggests to use React for rich web experiences, and use HTMX for pages with simpler interactivity.

- 📜 [Compiler Theory and Reactivity](https://www.recompiled.dev/blog/ssa/): Sathya works on React Forget and explains a compiler theory pass they use called Static Single Assignment form. I have to admit I’m a bit lost here 😅. His previous post on [Alias analysis](https://www.recompiled.dev/blog/alias-analysis/) is easier to understand.

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

This section is now co-authored with [Benedikt](https://twitter.com/bndkt). Feel free to send us your comments by email or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bndkt)!

This past week, we all enjoyed a brief respite from major headline React Native news (or did I miss something, in this case [@me](https://twitter.com/bndkt)). Perhaps that's a welcome change, especially after the whirlwind of events like Expo 50, visionOS, the State of React Native, react-strict-dom, and more. However, this doesn't mean the React Native world has come to a halt. There’s been a lot of little announcements that give us a glimpse in the near future of React Native. The first release candidates for [RN 0.74](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/ee2bc59dfe4579cad3b7f0b5de667a89fcac8710/CHANGELOG.md#0740-rc0) were released. They contain a lot of improvements as well as some deprecations and breaking changes, but from the first glance nothing major that makes me worried about upgrading effort. Most notably, bridgeless mode becomes the new default with 0.74 (but only when New Arch is enabled). Bridgeless mode is the third pillar of the New Arch, after the already introduced TurboModules and new renderer (Fabric). Speaking of New Arch and defaults, a [PR](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/43135) was merged that’ll make the New Arch the default beginning with RN 0.75 (it will still be possible to opt out though). Also, the RFC with the [React Native Frameworks](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/blob/main/proposals/0759-react-native-frameworks.md) definition has been merged, laying out the responsibilities of RN vs frameworks on top of RN.
