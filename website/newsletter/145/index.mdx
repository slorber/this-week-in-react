Hi everyone!

As expected a new version of Next.js is out. Some React innovations that are better documented in the Next.js doc than in the React one, like form `action`, or the 2 new hooks `useFormStatus` and `useOptimistic`.

There are a lot of conferences at the moment. Remix Conf and App.js starting today: there will surely be some nice announcements.

The [React-Native-Connection](https://reactnativeconnection.io/) (Paris, June 1st) is also a few weeks away, and you can have -20% discount with the code "REACTHEBDO"!

I plan to skip next week's edition. Next issue on May 24th 👋

## ⚛️ React {#react}

[![Next.js 13.4](/emails/issues/145/nextjs.jpg)](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13-4)

**[Next.js 13.4](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13-4)**

A major release for Next.js, with:

- App Router (stable): the new router based on Suspense and Server Components is ready for production
- Turbopack (beta): the new bundler is stabilizing in dev, and prod build is coming soon
- Server Actions (alpha): Next.js integration of the latest React innovations

The blog post shows many notable differences with the old router: conventions, nested layouts, selective hydration, server components, code splitting...

It also unveils the new React innovations to manage mutations and form submissions, whose integration in Next.js gives birth to Server Actions. This greatly simplifies interactions with the server without the need to create an API route and the use of forms supporting [progressive enhancement](https://twitter.com/acdlite/status/1654159613950828546). It is now possible to create and distribute full-stack React components.

Note that it is a bit early to adopt Server Actions in production. They are in alpha, and you could unexpectedly expose a secret captured in a Server Action closure to the client. Details here:

- 🧵 [Thread](https://twitter.com/tomus_sherman/status/1654198731313500174): warns of this issue
- 🐦 Problem recognized by [Sebastian Markbåge](https://twitter.com/sebmarkbage/status/1654212899097960448) and [Andrew Clark](https://twitter.com/acdlite/status/1654317374777032704) who propose to encrypt variables.

The canary releases are stable enough to be adopted in production. This is what Next.js App Router uses now, but also what Meta and React-Native always relied on.

They reimplemented `ReactDOMServer.renderToString` in OCaml to be able to run the SSR natively and solve some of their issues. Their SSR is now 10x faster than Node.js and 6x faster than Bun. The idea of running SSR natively is very interesting, but it will take a lot of work to support the latest innovations like streaming and Server Components.
- 📜 [HTMX is the Future](https://quii.dev/HTMX_is_the_Future): a critique of SPA frameworks, in particular React. Proposes to use an alternative: HTMX and hypermedia responses. I find it interesting for backend devs who want to add interactivity without doing JavaScript, but not sure that it scales that well.
