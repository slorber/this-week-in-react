[NLUX](https://nlux.ai?c-twr1-p1) *(for Natural Language User Experience)* is a new [open-source](https://github.com/nluxai/nlux) React / Javascript library that makes it simple to integrate powerful large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT into your web app or website. With just a few lines of code, you can add conversational AI capabilities and interact with your favourite LLM.

Key features 🌟 include:

*   **Build AI Chat Interfaces In Minutes** - High quality conversational AI interfaces with just a few lines of code.
    
*   **React Components & Hooks** - `<AiChat />` for UI and `useAdapter` hook for easy integration.
    
*   **Flexible LLM Adapters** - `ChatGPT` and `HuggingFace`, and an API to **Create Your Own Adapter** for any LLM.
    
*   **Customisable Chat Personas** - Configure bot and user pictures, names, and descriptions for personalised interactions.
    
*   **Zero Dependencies** - Lightweight codebase, with zero-dependencies except for LLM front-end libraries.
