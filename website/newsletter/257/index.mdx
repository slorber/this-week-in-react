Hi everyone, [Seb](https://x.com/sebastienlorber) and [Armand](https://www.linkedin.com/in/armandpetit/) here\! 👋

This week, we found various interesting React releases and links about directives, Partial Pre-Rendering, performance, micro-frontends, i18n, among other things.

On the React Native side, we had 2 major releases and various interesting weak signals. Beware of the RN Dev Server vulnerability, and make sure to upgrade if needed.

- 💸 [Product for Engineers - 32 things we’ve learned about building a startup that scales](https://go.posthog.com/twir-nov5)
- 🦋 [Navigation API \- Available in all browsers soon](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:hxmev3uady7j4litwnr5fzbg/post/3m4uqq6kplc24): This exciting new web platform API will soon be available in all browsers and will redefine how we build client-side / SPA navigation. Instead of using the awkward History API (not initially created for SPAs) and having a `<Link>` component that intercepts clicks to call `event.preventDefault()` and `history.pushState()`, there will be a central place to handle and intercept navigation events. The React team is working on a [Transition Indicator](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/33162) feature that leverages this API to provide native loading state feedback.
- 📜 [Partial Prerendering \- From error-based detection to promise-driven architecture for optimal web performance](https://wyattjoh.ca/blog/partial-prerendering): A Vercel engineer explains the motivation behind PPR, and why the first attempt \- based on throwing errors \- didn’t work. This led to a new Promise-based implementation \- dynamic IO \- later renamed as Cache Components.
- 📜 [Implementing Next.js 16 ‘use cache’ with next-intl Internationalization](https://aurorascharff.no/posts/implementing-nextjs-16-use-cache-with-next-intl-internationalization/): Explores an incompatibility between Next.js and the next-intl library due to reading the locale from `headers()`. An upcoming `rootParams` Next.js API should help support i18n and multi-tenancy use cases better.
- 📜 [Encapsulate as much state as possible in your component](https://blacksheepcode.com/posts/encapsulate_as_much_state_as_possible): I agree that it’s often better to encapsulate the loading state of a button triggering an async action instead of exposing that state as a controlled prop.
- 📜 [The New Programming Frontier: Why Vercel is Redefining "The Language"](https://dev.to/herrington_darkholme/the-new-programming-frontier-why-vercel-is-redefining-the-language-2ij0): A high-level article explaining the motivations behind directives. They provide language constructs to improve the DX of building distributed systems.
- 📜 [Why startups choose React (and when you shouldn't)](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/why-startups-choose-react-and-when-you-should-not): Although I don’t necessarily agree with the conclusion, it gives interesting stats about the React ecosystem, including its “library survival rate”.
- 📜 [Using Atomic State to Improve React Performance in Deeply Nested Component Trees](https://runharbor.com/blog/2025-10-26-improving-deeply-nested-react-render-performance-with-jotai-atomic-state): An interactive article showing how Jotai atoms can help prevent useless re-renders.
- 📜 [Quality Assurance for i18n in React](https://lingual.dev/blog/quality-assurance-for-i18n-in-react/): Explores how tools like `i18n-check` can detect missing or unused translation keys and integrate validation into CI to improve translation quality and consistency across React and React Native apps.

- 📦 [Immer 10.2](https://github.com/immerjs/immer/releases/tag/v10.2.0): Mark Erikson noticed a performance loss in recent versions of the popular state update library, and he’s on a journey to fix it. He also released [Redux Toolkit 2.10](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/releases/tag/v2.10.0), which picks up the initial set of Immer performance improvements.
- 📦 [React Concurrent Store \- Ponyfill of experimental React concurrent stores](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/271): A community-built version of the upcoming React Labs feature, whose goal is to test the integration into Redux and Relay. See this [related Redux PR](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/pull/2263) for more context.
- 📦 [Turborepo 2.6 \- Support for local microfrontend development, Bun package manager stable](https://turborepo.com/blog/turbo-2-6): It seems Vercel is working on features to improve microfrontend support. See also this [podcast with CTO Malte Ubi introducing Remote Components](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgfjhAy85UI), which should be supported by Next.js later.

[![React Native + Godot — A new frontier for hybrid apps](/emails/issues/257/godot.jpg)](https://github.com/borndotcom/react-native-godot)

**[React Native \+ Godot — A new frontier for hybrid apps](https://github.com/borndotcom/react-native-godot)**

Born React Native Godot bridges the Godot game engine directly into React Native apps, letting you embed full 2D/3D scenes and physics worlds as native views. Built by Born and Migeran, it runs on iOS and Android with a dedicated engine thread, pause/resume controls, and complete Godot API access from TypeScript.

Core features:

- Cross-platform – Works seamlessly on Android and iOS via LibGodot.
- Lifecycle control – Start, stop, or restart the Godot engine dynamically.
- Pause/Resume – Halt and resume engine execution without losing state.
- Thread isolation – Runs on its own thread to prevent UI jank.
- View embedding – Place Godot scenes inside any React Native view.
- Full Godot API – Access and control nodes, scenes, and signals from JS/TS.
- Worklet bridge – Use React Native Worklets to interact with the engine thread.

This release turns React Native into a true playground for interactive and game-driven experiences merging UI and gameplay in one unified codebase.

[![Uniwind — The fastest Tailwind bindings for React Native️](/emails/issues/257/uniwind.jpg)](https://www.reactnativecrossroads.com/posts/introducing-uniwind-the-fastest-tailwind-bindings-for-react-native)

**[Uniwind — The fastest Tailwind bindings for React Native️](https://www.reactnativecrossroads.com/posts/introducing-uniwind-the-fastest-tailwind-bindings-for-react-native)**

Uniwind brings true Tailwind-style `className` support to React Native, offering build-time speed, seamless theming, and cross-platform styling across web, iOS, and Android.  
Created by the team behind Unistyles, it’s designed to unify design systems, accelerate UI builds, and replace ad-hoc styling with a consistent, high-performance approach :

- Effortless Multi-Theme Support – Register unlimited light/dark or custom themes directly in your Metro config.
- Automatic React Native Bindings – Every core RN component supports `className`, plus extra props like `colorClassName`.
- 2.5× Faster Than NativeWind – Build-time caching and Nitro-module integration ensure instant style resolution.
- HeroUI Native Collaboration – First UI kit built entirely on Uniwind, proving real-world compatibility and speed.
- Pseudo-classes \+ Responsive Design – Use `focus`, `active`, `disabled`, and media queries just like on the web.
- Ready for Scale – Backed by Unistyles tech and optimized for enterprise-grade cross-platform styling.
