Hi everyone!

This week is calm in terms of releases, so far at least!. We have great React articles, but also some criticisms, or content that suggests we use alternative solutions (Solid, Phoenix LiveView) 😅.

React Conf starts later today! We can expect great things to be presented there, that we'll cover next week. I sent the newsletter a bit earlier today to make sure I can watch it live without any pressure 😄.

The [React Conf YouTube live stream link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8TZQ6k4SLE) is already available. Looking at the [conf agenda](https://conf.react.dev/agenda), we are particularly excited about the following talks:

- React and React Native keynotes and Q&A
- Universal React Server Components in Expo Router - Evan Bacon - Expo
- Real-time server components - Sunil Pai - PartyKit
- Spatial computing with React - Michał Pierzchała - Callstack
- Cross Platform React - Olga Zinoveva and Naman Goel - Meta

Speaking of conferences, the U.S. React Native Conference [**Chain React**](https://chainreactconf.com/?utm_source=thisweekinreact) is back on July 17-19 (Portland/OR). We partnered to offer you 15% off your ticket with code “TWIR”.

[![Snappy UI Optimization with useDeferredValue](/emails/issues/185/useDeferredValue.jpg)](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/use-deferred-value/)

**[Snappy UI Optimization with useDeferredValue](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/use-deferred-value/)**

Josh Comeau comes back with a great blog post showing the usefulness of the `useDeferredValue()` hook, that allows you to opt-in for Concurrent React by deferring the rendering of expensive components to a lower priority task. He presents a very concrete performance problem he was facing and how the hook helped solve it in practice. For this to work efficiently, it is important that you wrap your expensive components with `memo()`. The interactive timelines can help you understand how this is different from throttling.

[![Why React Query?](/emails/issues/185/reactquery.jpg)](https://ui.dev/why-react-query)

**[Why React Query?](https://ui.dev/why-react-query)**

Dominik Dorfmeister is launching his official React Query course, and for the occasion published the first lesson for free. It's a great interactive article that slowly builds up on everything React Query does for you, including handling race conditions, deduping requests, and caching. It's really full-featured and more like an "async state manager" rather than just a library to fetch data. An interesting read for all React devs, even if you don't use React Query.

- 📖 [React Docs - StrictMode - Fixing bugs by re-running ref callbacks in development](https://19.react.dev/reference/react/StrictMode#fixing-bugs-found-by-re-running-ref-callbacks-in-development): I shared last week that refs are firing twice in React 19 StrictMode. This is for good reasons, and this new doc section explains how it can prevent bugs, notably when dealing with lists of refs.

This requires the runtime to support a waitUntil function, a feature that [Vercel just shipped](https://vercel.com/changelog/waituntil-is-now-available-for-vercel-functions) (that Cloudflare already had). Particularly useful for logging/analytics without delaying the response.

[![Refine - Open source Retool Alternative](/emails/issues/177/refine.jpg)](https://github.com/refinedev/refine)

**[Refine - Open source Retool Alternative](https://github.com/refinedev/refine)**

The sweet spot between the low code and traditional development for CRUD-heavy applications.

As an open-source React meta-framework designed for Enterprise applications, [Refine](https://github.com/refinedev/refine) offers a headless solution ideal for tasks like admin panels, dashboards, and internal tools.

While low-code tools may offer initial promise, they often fall short in handling complex scenarios due to scalability issues, limited customization options, and the risk of vendor lock-in.

Refine enables teams to rapidly develop production-ready apps while maintaining flexibility.
