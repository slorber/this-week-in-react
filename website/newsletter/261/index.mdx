Hi everyone\!

A major React 19 Server Functions vulnerability has just been disclosed. Make sure to upgrade your React 19 or meta-framework ASAP\!

Don’t forget to answer the [State of React 2025 survey](https://survey.devographics.com/en-US/survey/state-of-react/2025?source=thisweekinreact.com) while it’s still open\!

[![React 19 Critical Security Vulnerability in React Server Components](/emails/issues/261/react.jpg)](https://react.dev/blog/2025/12/03/critical-security-vulnerability-in-react-server-components)

**[React 19 Critical Security Vulnerability in React Server Components](https://react.dev/blog/2025/12/03/critical-security-vulnerability-in-react-server-components)**

A critical (10.0) security vulnerability affects React 19\. It allows unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in React Server Components by crafting a malicious HTTP request sent to a Server Function endpoint.

The React team recommends upgrading immediately. The vulnerability has been responsibly disclosed, and patches are already available for React 19 and the most popular frameworks that leverage RSCs: Next.js, Expo, React Router, Waku, Redwood, and more. Hosting providers can mitigate the issue thanks to their Web Application Firewalls.

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

[![RNRepo - Faster React Native Builds Through Prebuilt Artifacts](/emails/issues/261/rnrepo.jpg)](https://blog.swmansion.com/rnrepo-faster-react-native-builds-through-prebuilt-artifacts-004903b5e510)

**[RNRepo \- Faster React Native Builds Through Prebuilt Artifacts](https://blog.swmansion.com/rnrepo-faster-react-native-builds-through-prebuilt-artifacts-004903b5e510)**

Software Mansion just unveiled RNRepo, a new infrastructure project aiming to speed up our React Native builds.

The idea is to prebuild popular native libraries against multiple React Native versions ahead of time, and host the artifacts on a Maven repository. Then, you can configure your build to download the prebuilt artifacts instead of building them locally, saving time and disk space. This should complete nicely the speed improvements we get with React Native core prebuilds and the Expo Build Cache providers.

For now, RNRepo is in beta. It only supports Android and 40 popular libraries, but iOS support is coming, and the community can request support for additional libraries.
