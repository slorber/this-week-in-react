[Next.js 16](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-16)

The new major version of Next.js just dropped as a stable release, just before [Next.js Conf 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdIgkiDu-94), which is currently taking place. We’ll cover the conf announcements next week, in particular the new Cache Components features that is quite an important piece to explore.

The beta was already out 2 weeks ago with the following highlights:

- Turbopack (stable): enabled by default. Promises up to 5-10x faster Fast Refresh, and 2-5x faster builds
- Turbopack file system caching (beta): Faster startup and compile times
- React Compiler Support (stable): need to be manually enabled
- Optimized navigations and prefetching: Prefetching multiple URLs that share a layout now downloads that layout only once which cuts down on network transfer size.
- Improved Caching APIs: New `updateTag()` and refined `revalidateTag()`
- Build Adapters API (alpha): Create custom adapters to modify the build process
- React 19.2: `<Activity>`, View Transitions, `useEffectEvent`

Since the beta, they have also introduced new exciting features:

- Cache Components: New model using Partial Pre-Rendering (PPR) and `’use cache’` for instant navigation.
- Next.js Devtools MCP: Model Context Protocol integration for improved debugging and workflow
- Proxy: Middleware replaced by `proxy.ts` to clarify the network boundary
- DX: Improved logging for builds and development requests

[Solito v5 – Bridging React Native and Next.js made simpler](https://solito.dev/v5)

Solito, the library that connects React Native and Next.js navigation, has reached its fifth version and further simplifies life for cross-platform developers.

This major upgrade removes the dependency on react-native-web: on the web side, Solito components now return native Next.js components, with direct support for DOM props. The goal is to let you write pure Next.js for the web, while maintaining an identical API on the mobile side, without any special configuration.

This new version also includes:

- No more react-native-web – Solito components such as `<Link>` , `<TextLink>` or `<NavigationProvider>` directly re-export Next.js components and accept className, style, etc.
- Headless components on the web – no default styles; it's up to you to use Tailwind/CSS.
- Support for Next.js 16 & Expo SDK 54 – the monorepo examples have been updated with Turbopack and the new versions of Next.js and Expo.
- Fixes & improvements – the `useSearchParams` hook now works correctly on mobile, and .`web.tsx` files are being phased out in favour of `.native.tsx` for native code.
