Hi everyone!

No major React announcements this week, probably due to the US presidential election.

But we still had a bunch of exciting React and React Native and great community articles. I'm particularly excited about the React Compiler direction, and the release of React Navigation 7 with a new screen preloading API. Shopify's React Native endorsement is also great news for our ecosystem. Of course, I'm happy to unveil what I've been working on for months on Docusaurus too!

Don't forget to answer the [State of React 2024 survey](https://survey.devographics.com/en-US/survey/state-of-react/2024?source=this_week_in_react). It's closing next week, and we still have less answers than last year so far. If you have an audience, please help spread the word, and add a [`?source=my_name` parameter](https://github.com/Devographics/surveys/issues/250#issuecomment-2423485429) so that survey bias can be tracked.

🎥 [**Sathya Gunasekaran \- What's next for the React Compiler?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd5yk2gxbtg)

I finally caught up with this great talk that announced the [React compiler beta](https://react.dev/blog/2024/10/21/react-compiler-beta-release), but also unveiled a few other interesting. The compiler is not just about auto-memoization, but is a platform to build more optimizations on. 3 upcoming features presented:

- Type config: You can help the compiler do a better job by providing extra type information.
- JSX Inlining: The compiler can remove useless JSX runtime calls, replace them with pre-built JSX objects. `jsx('div')` becomes `{type: 'div'}`.
- JSX Outlining: The compiler can extract subcomponents automatically, that can then be optimized independently. This is particularly useful for list elements when using `array.map` and inlined JSX, the compiler can create an `<Item>` component (see the talk screenshot, otherwise [this PR](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/30956) explains it well).

[![Introducing @clerk/nextjs v6 - Next.js 15 compatible](/emails/issues/208/clerk.jpg)](https://go.clerk.com/763LGC2)

**[Introducing @clerk/nextjs v6 - Next.js 15 compatible](https://go.clerk.com/763LGC2)**

The Next.js team has announced the stable release of Next.js 15, and Clerk is continuing the tradition of (nearly) same-day support for new major Next.js releases with the release of `@clerk/nextjs` v6. With v6, the `auth()` helper is now asynchronous, `<ClerkProvider>` defaults to static rendering instead of dynamic, and support for partial pre-rendering has been introduced.

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

[![React Navigation 7.0](/emails/issues/208/reactnavigation7.jpg)](https://reactnavigation.org/blog/2024/11/06/react-navigation-7.0/)

[**React Navigation 7.0**](https://reactnavigation.org/blog/2024/11/06/react-navigation-7.0/)

React Navigation v7 is now out and should power the upcoming Expo Router v4 coming with Expo SDK 52, both in beta. My favorite highlights are:

- Screen preloading: You can prepare screens ahead of time prior to navigating to them and improve the perceived performance. This one is really exciting and might be able to use Concurrent React features in the future.
- Static API: Simplifies the navigator configuration, and makes it easier to work with TypeScript and deep linking.
