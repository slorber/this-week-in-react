[![Introducing @clerk/nextjs v6 - Next.js 15 compatible](/emails/issues/208/clerk.jpg)](https://go.clerk.com/763LGC2)

**[Introducing @clerk/nextjs v6 - Next.js 15 compatible](https://go.clerk.com/763LGC2)**

The Next.js team has announced the stable release of Next.js 15, and Clerk is continuing the tradition of (nearly) same-day support for new major Next.js releases with the release of `@clerk/nextjs` v6. With v6, the `auth()` helper is now asynchronous, `<ClerkProvider>` defaults to static rendering instead of dynamic, and support for partial pre-rendering has been introduced.

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

[![React Navigation 7.0](/emails/issues/208/reactnavigation7.jpg)](https://reactnavigation.org/blog/2024/11/06/react-navigation-7.0/)

[**React Navigation 7.0**](https://reactnavigation.org/blog/2024/11/06/react-navigation-7.0/)

React Navigation v7 is now out and should power the upcoming Expo Router v4 coming with Expo SDK 52, both in beta. My favorite highlights are:

- Screen preloading: You can prepare screens ahead of time prior to navigating to them to increase perceived performance.
- Static API: Simplifies the navigator configuration, and makes it easier to work with TypeScript and deep linking.
