**[Introducing @clerk/nextjs v6 - Next.js 15 compatible](https://go.clerk.com/763LGC2)**

The Next.js team has announced the stable release of Next.js 15, and Clerk is continuing the tradition of (nearly) same-day support for new major Next.js releases with the release of `@clerk/nextjs` v6. With v6, the `auth()` helper is now asynchronous, `<ClerkProvider>` defaults to static rendering instead of dynamic, and support for partial pre-rendering has been introduced.
