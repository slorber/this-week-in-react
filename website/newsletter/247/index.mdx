- 👀 [React Context Selectors RFC update](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/119#issuecomment-3214859601): Joe Savona from the React Compiler team shared an important update regarding fine-grained subscriptions in React to prevent re-renders. It reminds us why Context selectors do not scale well. They won’t pursue the “useContext in useMemo” plan anymore and instead focus on React Compiler and Concurrent Stores with selectors (but this plan may change).
- 👀 [React Types PR \- Fragment Refs](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/72348/files): React fragments are set to become more powerful with this upcoming experimental feature, briefly mentioned in the latest React Labs post. The PR gives a sneak peek of the exposed Fragment Instance APIs. React Native should also expose dedicated APIs.
- 👀 [React PR \- `name` prop for `<Suspense>` and `<Activity>`](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/34135): This upcoming experimental prop looks mostly useful in React DevTools to quickly identify built-in components and search for them.
- 👀 [Next.js PR \- `export const prefetch: ‘static’ | ‘runtime’`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/82905): This work-in-progress and unstable new API should let you control how path segments are prefetched.

- 📜 [React’s useTransition and state update reordering](https://jordaneldredge.com/notes/react-rebasing/): This documents a super interesting case to consider regarding the application order of `setState(incrementCounter)` updates when mixing synchronous and startTransition calls. I had the wrong intuition for the final counter value.

- 📦 [Apollo Client 4.0 \- Framework-agnostic, smaller bundler size, unified error handling, better TS support](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/releases/tag/%40apollo/client%404.0.0): The GraphQL client becomes agnostic and introduces a new `@apollo/client/react` integration package. There are React-specific improvements, such as a new SSR `prerenderStatic` API, and the library ships precompiled with the React Compiler. Codemods can help you upgrade.
