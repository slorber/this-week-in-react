Hi everyone!

I thought this week was going to be pretty quiet, but I found a lot of interesting stuff, both on the React and React-Native side!

The newsletter has just [passed 25,000 subscribers](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/status/1689285394855022592)! Thank you for reading me every week and allowing me to continue this adventure.

## ⚛️ React {#react}

[![Devtools for React Server Components](/emails/issues/155/rscdevtools.jpg)](https://www.alvar.dev/blog/creating-devtools-for-react-server-components)

[**Devtools for React Server Components**](https://www.alvar.dev/blog/creating-devtools-for-react-server-components)

Following the release of the React Server Components, Alvar noticed that network communication between client and server used a format that was difficult to decipher. So he started work on a website [RSC Parser](https://rsc-parser.vercel.app/) that allows payloads to be inspected more conveniently. It worked, but the UX wasn't ideal. Since then, he's been working on a real browser extension that works a bit like Chrome's Network DevTools, with a timeline that shows payloads over time and even supports streaming with Suspense. This tool has already enabled him to detect overly large payloads on his blog and optimise them.

It's a promising tool, still under development and worth keeping an eye on. The extension is not yet available in the browser stores, but will be soon. A few video demos in this [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/status/1689203357368365056).

[![Caching in Next.js](/emails/issues/155/cachinginnextjs.jpg)](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/caching)

[**Caching in Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/caching)

A new Next.js documentation page provides a comprehensive explanation of how the 4 levels of caching work, why they exist and how to bypass them:

- Request Memoization
- Data Cache
- Full Route Cache
- Router Cache

It is not possible to bypass the Router cache: a problem that is highlighted in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yhSh4g0NSk).

[![Radix UI Themes](/emails/issues/155/radix.jpg)](https://www.radix-ui.com/)

[**Radix UI Themes**](https://www.radix-ui.com/)

Radix UI is a headless React library that's been getting a lot of praise lately, not least for the elegant design of its API. They've just announced with a nice trailer ([on Twitter](https://twitter.com/radix_ui/status/1688889619314585600)) that Radix now offers a set of styled components in addition to their primitive ones.

**[A Non-Cloud Alternative to Google Forms that has it all](https://surveyjs.io/?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=email)**

If you are looking to set up a robust form management system fully integrated in your IT infrastructure that allows you to retain full control over the data flow, and you don’t want to spend months and thousands of dollars to get it up and running, then SurveyJS is the way to go!

SurveyJS is a product suite of four open-source JavaScript libraries that allow you to create and edit multiple dynamic JSON-based forms in a drag-and-drop form builder, render them in your React app and store sensitive survey data within your in-house infrastructure. You can then render your custom surveys and forms as editable PDF files in a browser and visualize survey results with interactive charts and tables.
