Hi everyone!

This week we have many great React articles and a few interesting releases. It seems that React is constantly being criticized, but overall, the arguments are always the same and many of them seems a bit outdated, and never acknowledging what React does better than other solutions.

The React Native world is taken over by the official launch of Vision Pro!

We are trying something new this week, with a very first [Twitter thread dedicated to React Native](https://twitter.com/bndkt/status/1755203992039424377). Let us know if you like it.

The newsletter will be on a break next week. We'll be back the 21th of February 👋.

I'd also like to ask you a small favor: can you reply to this e-mail with a simple "hello" or a comment? This helps increase our email deliverability. Thanks!

[![Million 3.0](/emails/issues/173/million.jpg)](https://million.dev/blog/million-3)

**[Million 3.0](https://million.dev/blog/million-3)**

Million is an optimizing compiler for React. This new major version is a complete rewrite that fixes caveats of previous versions, handles more edge cases, brings a new optimized hydration system and improves stability.

It looks like Million is planning to help us debug and maintain great web performance over time. According to their 🐦 [launch trailer](https://twitter.com/aidenybai/status/1753456530652107072), a million linter is on the roadmap.

[![Announcing React Native for Apple Vision Pro](/emails/issues/173/visionos.jpg)](https://www.callstack.com/blog/announcing-react-native-for-apple-vision-pro)

**[Announcing React Native for Apple Vision Pro](https://www.callstack.com/blog/announcing-react-native-for-apple-vision-pro)**

Last week, Apple released their Apple Vision Pro, and at least parts of the React Native community are excited about a new platform for which they’ll be able to build experiences with their favorite framework. There are two different approaches (🐦 [side-by-side comparison](https://twitter.com/o_kwasniewski/status/1754520654219493408)) to bring React Native onto visionPro:

- Similar to how you can run an iOS app on macOS you can check a box in App Store Connect and enable your app to run on visionOS “as is,” using compatibility mode. Check out how 🐦 [Evan Bacon provisions, builds, and installs an Expo app on visionPro in under 10 minutes](https://twitter.com/Baconbrix/status/1753927218697208102). Apps in compatibility mode don’t take advantage of the “spatial computing” capabilities of visionOS though, they’re merely an iPad screen shown in the room.

- To build apps that are truly optimized for this new world, additional native capabilities need to be adapted. And that is exactly what this new visionOS platform is doing, driven by Oskar Kwaśniewski and brought to us by Callstack.

It’s early days, but it's super exciting to see RN embrace a new platform so quickly! The very first React Native visionOS app [Spacial Noise](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spatial-noise/id6477335349) is already available on the App Store.

- 💸 [Moropo - Mobile Testing Infrastructure That Integrates Seamlessly With Expo EAS ](https://www.moropo.com?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=emails&utm_campaign=twir-20240207)
- 👀 [RFC - React Native Frameworks](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/pull/759): Did you ever wonder where the boundary between React Native, Expo, and other community tools is? Lines are blurry, and this RFC aims to clarify things by introducing the concept of “React Native Frameworks.”
- 👀 [CSS4 color functions](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/42831) and [DisplayP3 color](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/42830): More color options (e.g. Wide Gamut) coming to React Native.

Thanks to Expo config plugins, experimental support for Apple TV and Android TV is now directly available. This is a super exciting development, which I’m sure will continue with macOS, visionOS, …
- 📖 [Improved Metro bundler docs from Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/customizing-metro/): Explaining how bundle splitting, tree shaking, and minification work and and how Metro is now also used for the web.
- 📜 [What every dev should know about using Environment Variables](https://expo.dev/blog/what-are-environment-variables): Handling environment variables in RN correctly is critical, as you otherwise run the risk of shipping (and therefore exposing) secrets to the client.
- 📜 [Fingerprint your native runtime with @expo/fingerprint](https://expo.dev/blog/fingerprint-your-native-runtime): Determining whether an update to the JS bundle of a RN app requires a new native build is a tricky question. With SDK 50, Expo released Fingerprint, which basically creates a single hash value representing all the “native surface area” of a RN app and can then be used to trigger a new native build.
- 📜 [6 reasons to use EAS Update](https://expo.dev/blog/6-reasons-to-use-eas-update): Did you know about the republish feature? I didn’t, before reading this article. In case of a messed up upgrade, you can quickly republish a previous (working) update!
