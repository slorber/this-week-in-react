Hi everyone!

This week is difficult to sum up, there's a lot of interesting news and I don't know which to highlight.

We notably have a sneak peek of a new React core hook replacing the confusing `useFormState`, that even React Native devs will now be able to use now!

[![React Core PR - New useActionState hook](/emails/issues/176/useActionState.jpg)](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/28491)

**[React Core PR - New useActionState hook](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/28491)**

It turns out the useFormState hook was confusing, and not even meant to be solely used in forms. The React team is addressing this by introducing a new React core hook to replace it:

- Renames `useFormState` to `useActionState`
- Adds a pending state to the returned tuple
- Moves the hook to the `react` package

Moving it from `react-dom` to `react` also means that now, other renderers such as React Native can use it too. There are other benefits to look at, such as a “partial progressive enhancement” feature, but also new caveats documented in the PR.

- 🐦 [React 19 != React Compiler](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/status/1764950877620654474): The React Labs post is a bit ambiguous and misled many of us, so let’s clarify. The compiler will likely come after the React 19.0 release as a separate project, and there’s a good chance it will initially be released as a Babel/TypeScript plugin. The internals are decoupled through, so it shouldn’t take long to adapt it it to Rust.
- 🐦 [TanStack Start preview](https://twitter.com/tannerlinsley/status/1765120904370307438): Tanner works on a TanStack Start full-stack framework based on Vinxi and TanStack Router. This preview shows he’s migrating his own TanStack site to it.

- 📜 [Secure statically rendered paid content in Next.js (with the App Router)](https://www.ericburel.tech/blog/static-paid-content-app-router): Shows that using Next.js layouts for authentication is not super secure, and the protected content can still leak through the RSC endpoint. Suggests using a middleware instead.
- 📜 [Internationalization with Remix](https://remix.run/blog/remix-i18n): Goes back to i18n fundamentals, and then detail various i18n solutions you can set up within Remix. Optional route segments can help you use localized sub-directories.

Also great to learn about advanced TypeScript type-level programming techniques.
- 📜 [Streaming HTML out of order without JavaScript](https://lamplightdev.com/blog/2024/01/10/streaming-html-out-of-order-without-javascript/): This super interesting demo shows we don’t need JavaScript to stream out-of-order HTML chunks, and yet render them in the correct order. All you need is Declarative Shadow DOM and slots. It will be interesting to see if RSC streaming + Suspense could leverage that technique in the future instead of inlining JavaScript.

[![Improving Shopify App’s Performance](/emails/issues/176/shopify.jpg)](https://shopify.engineering/improving-shopify-app-s-performance)

**[Improving Shopify App’s Performance](https://shopify.engineering/improving-shopify-app-s-performance)**

Shopify has been a proponent of React Native for a long time. But they did notice their app performance go down since they migrated to React Native. Instead of blaming the tech stack, they got to work and started optimizing for performance. The results speak for themselves: App launch is 44 % faster and screen load times were reduced by 59 %. Here’s a quick summary of some of the measures they took (hint: FlashList plays a big role in some of these). For details, read their great summary post:

- Initially, only render what’s visible on the screen (especially true for the home screen)
- Build all screens as lists (based on FlashList)
- Use inlineRequires
- Batch state changes
- Optimize caching

Very interesting insights and impressive results. I hope the Shopify team keeps sharing these details and maybe we’ll even see some of the things they mentioned they built during this process ending up as Open Source?
