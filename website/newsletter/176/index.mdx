**[Axiom - the best logging platform for Vercel apps](https://axiom.co/vercel)**

😴 Sleep peacefully knowing that Axiom’s zero-config observability for Vercel projects has you covered.

- Use Axiom's pre-built dashboard for an overview across all your Vercel logs and vitals, drill down to specific projects and deployments, and get insight on how functions are performing with a single click.
- [next-axiom](https://github.com/axiomhq/next-axiom) allows you to send logs and events from any part of your Next.js projects - client, edge, or server-side - without any special configuration.
- Easily send structured logs directly from your code and analyze them together with Vercel logs.

Axiom efficiently captures 100% of your event data so you’ll never have to worry about sampling or retention, and you’ll never have to guess what your users are experiencing.
