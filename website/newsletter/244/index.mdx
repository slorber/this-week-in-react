Hi everyone!

Apparently, not everyone is on vacation yet because it's a great week.

On the React side, we have an early version of React Server Components support in React Router, and a new comprehensive React Compiler docs.

It's even more exciting for React Native developers: Reanimated v4 is now stable, and Screens now support native tabs, coming soon in Expo!

I also take the opportunity to warn that an [npm phishing attack](https://socket.dev/blog/npm-is-package-hijacked-in-expanding-supply-chain-attack) is currently in progress, targeting maintainers of popular packages. Don't trust any email coming from `npmjs.org`, they are spoofed.

import Support from "../_support.mdx";

[![React Router and React Server Components: The Path Forward](/emails/issues/244/reactrouter.jpg)](https://remix.run/blog/react-router-and-react-server-components)

**[React Router and React Server Components: The Path Forward](https://remix.run/blog/react-router-and-react-server-components)**

The new [React Router v7.7](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v770) release introduces experimental RSC APIs to use alongside RSC-compatible bundlers (Vite, Parcel) that you can now use in [Data Mode](https://reactrouter.com/start/modes#data), making it almost as powerful as the Framework Mode. In the future, the Framework Mode is also going to migrate to use React Router RSC APIs under the hood.

Reading the [React Server Components docs](https://reactrouter.com/how-to/react-server-components), the integration doesn’t look so simple, so I guess most React Router users may prefer waiting for RSC support in Framework Mode. However, it’s cool that they expose all primitives to bring RSCs to your existing app, and make it possible to create your own RSC-powered Framework Mode somehow.

![React Compiler being recommended on the useCallback docs](/emails/issues/244/compiler.png)

**React Compiler getting ready for prime time?**

Recently, the [React Compiler docs](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler) have been completely rewritten, divided into several pages, and given a more prominent place on the React docs site. There’s also a new [API reference](https://react.dev/reference/react-compiler/configuration) section covering configuration, directives, and pre-compiling a React library before distribution.

The React Compiler is now recommended in other places of the docs as a [better alternative to `React.memo`](https://react.dev/reference/react/memo#react-compiler-memo), `useMemo,` and `useCallback`. In the future, [eslint-plugin-react-hooks may enable the compiler rules by default](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/33509). It’s still a Release Candidate, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see it become stable soon, probably at [React Conf](https://conf.react.dev/) in October given the line-up.

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

[![Reanimated 4 Stable Release — the Future of React Native Animations](/emails/issues/244/reanimated.jpg)](https://blog.swmansion.com/reanimated-4-stable-release-the-future-of-react-native-animations-ba68210c3713)

**[Reanimated 4 Stable Release — the Future of React Native Animations](https://blog.swmansion.com/reanimated-4-stable-release-the-future-of-react-native-animations-ba68210c3713)**

This is a massive release that greatly improves the Reanimated. Highlights include:

- CSS Transitions and Animations: taking the best part of CSS animations a bringing it to React Native through a familiar and convenient declarative API, that improves performance and web/mobile cross-platform support along the way. It should be particularly useful for state-driven micro-interactions, but worklets aren’t going anywhere and remain the go-to choice for complex and gesture/scroll-driven animations.
- Worklets have been extracted to a separate library that Reanimated depends on, starting \>= v3.17. Richer multi-threading APIs should come soon, with the ability to move heavy computation, data fetching/processing to a background thread, with the ability to use third-party libraries in worklets.
- Reanimated has been split into many modular packages to help reduce bundle size, particularly useful on the web.
- Shared Element Transitions coming in an upcoming v4.x version.
- Reanimated v4 is not only compatible with the New Architecture.
