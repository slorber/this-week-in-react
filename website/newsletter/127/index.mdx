**[FlyCode Makes React Apps Editable without coding, Git based](https://bit.ly/3UPwAoJ)**

[FlyCode](https://bit.ly/3wWSi00) (YC S22) makes React web apps editable in minutes so Product and UX teams can iterate and release products faster, so they don't have to wait on (or consume) developer time.

FlyCode reads your regular React code and finds Texts, Images, Design tokens and Analytics event, then it let's non-coders collaborate and edit them and send back a pull request (they don't need access to GitHub!)

- Saves development time
- No code integration, it just reads your code!
- GitHub based, a bot is scanning the code and creates pull requests
- Use your own stack and components
- Retain codebase ownership

You can get started here: [flycode.com/developers](https://www.flycode.com/developers)
