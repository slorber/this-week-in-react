Hi everyone!

This week is a big one: we barely had time to recover from last week's React 19.2 release, and now **React Conf** is happening live with another bunch of exclusive announcements!

I'll let you discover it all for yourselves below, enjoy!👌

**[Convex: The Database Designed for AI Coding](https://convex.link/thisweekai)**

In the age of code generation, you need a backend that you can confidently generate with AI platforms. Convex is by far and away [best in class](https://stack.convex.dev/introducing-fullstack-bench) in this respect.

This is because Convex is just TypeScript, allowing you to write [queries as code](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions/) that are automatically transactional, cached, and realtime.

And that’s just the beginning. With Convex, you can:

- Easily schedule functions and write cron jobs
- Set up file storage
- Write efficient server functions
- And so much more…

![React Conf](/emails/issues/253/reactconf.png)

**React Conf is happening right now\!**

We already got [great announcements on day 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyVRg2QR6LA) about React core features, and [day 2 is still live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9OcztRyDl0), focusing more on React Native and frameworks.

Of course, we got an overview of the new exciting features coming with [React 19.2](https://react.dev/blog/2025/10/01/react-19-2) (covered last week), but that's not all—they also saved a few exclusive announcements for the conference:

- [**`<ViewTransition>`**](https://react.dev/reference/react/ViewTransition) is now available in Canary\*\* and lets you animate elements that update inside a Transition, also supporting Shared Elements Transitions. It currently only works in the DOM, but they are working on adding support for React Native and other platforms
- [**`<Fragment ref={...}>`**](https://react.dev/reference/react/Fragment#fragmentinstance) is now available in Canary\*\* and provides a new way to compose platform behaviors by exposing an imperative API to manipulate the children nodes of the Fragment
- [**The React Foundation**](https://react.dev/blog/2025/10/07/introducing-the-react-foundation) – hosted under the Linux Foundation – to become the new home of React, React Native and JSX. It will support the community and its ecosystem through a new independent technical governance structure to ensure the future of React. The founding corporate members will be Amazon, Callstack, Expo, Meta, Microsoft, Software Mansion, and Vercel. It is part of the Linux Foundation
- **React Compiler is now 1.0\!** It deeply understands your React code and should be able to optimize it for any platform, but also report problems through the new ESLint plugin integration. The React Compiler is recommended for all new apps, and existing apps can adopt it incrementally. The team also shared their research on new Compiler-based F-word React performance projects called Forest (a runtime based on signal-like lazy computation graph) and Fir (a constrained version of React, hybrid eager/lazy incremental rendering).
- **React Native 0.82** – freshly announced and covered in the dedicated section – the very first version that only supports the New Architecture.
- Probably more coming as the conference is still ongoing!

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

[![React Native 0.82 - A New Era](/emails/issues/253/rn.jpg)](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2025/10/08/react-native-0.82)

**[React Native 0.82 \- A New Era](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2025/10/08/react-native-0.82)**

React Native now runs entirely on the New Architecture, and you cannot opt-out anymore. It’s a milestone release, and the start of a new era where there Legacy Architecture will be progressively removed.

This new version also includes:

- Experimental support for Hermes V1 – the next evolution of Hermes – as opt-in flag. More details in this Software Mansion article: [Welcoming the Next Generation of Hermes](https://blog.swmansion.com/welcoming-the-next-generation-of-hermes-67ab5679e184).
- React 19.1.1 with full support for owner stacks (improving the debugging experience) and improving the reliability of `useDeferredValue` and `startTransition`.
- DOM Nodes API: this one is quite exciting for cross-platform development\! The `<View ref>` will expose a DOM-like immutable Element node, exposing a subset of the DOM APIs to perform imperative operations on the UI tree.
- Web Performance APIs: partial support in canary release level.
- Support for Android `debugOptimized` build type.
