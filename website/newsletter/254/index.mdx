Hi everyone\! Krzysztof and Kacper from Software Mansion here\! 👋

We don't know about you, but we're still living and breathing the news from last week's React conf.

In the previous issue, we covered the first day of React Conf, but when it comes to React Native, many announcements took place on the second day, including VirtualView and the sneak peek into React Native 0.83.

Aside from React conf announcements, Next.js 16 has been released in beta, and Remix 3 has been introduced.

Let’s go\!

- INTRO:  [RNLConf](https://www.reactnativelondon.co.uk/?utm_source=thisweekinreact) -  London - 13-14 Nov.

![Next.js 16 beta](/emails/issues/254/nextjs-16-beta.png)

[Next.js 16 beta](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-16-beta%20)

A new major version of Next.js got released in beta. This is the best time to try the newest features and share the feedback with the team. Highlights for this release include:

- Turbopack (stable): enabled by default. Promises up to 5-10x faster Fast Refresh, and 2-5x faster builds.
- Turbopack file system caching (beta): Faster startup and compile times
- React Compiler Support (stable): need to be manually enabled
- Optimized navigations and prefetching: Prefetching multiple URLs that share a layout now downloads that layout only once which cuts down on network transfer size.
- Improved Caching APIs: New `updateTag()` and refined `revalidateTag()`
- Build Adapters API (alpha): Create custom adapters to modify the build process
- React 19.2: `<Activity>`, View Transitions, `useEffectEvent`

🎥 [Remix Jam 2025 \- Introducing Remix 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt_iEOn2a6Y&t=11764s)

Ryan and Micheal introduced for the very first time Remix v3 in a 3h+ conf talk, and Seb watched it all so that you don’t have to. This new major version does not use React anymore, but we think it still deserves to be featured here. It’s not even in alpha yet, but still worth exploring.

On the client, it remains quite similar to React (using declarative JSX) but it has a setup function that runs only once (like Solid), state is managed imperatively and re-renders are triggered manually with `this.update()` (good idea? time will tell 😅). It also has a quite interesting composable event system that lets you build custom interactions and move “event state” outside of your components (when you’d probably use refs in React).

On the server, it’s built on top of a scalable router with advanced pattern matching and typesafe reverse routing. It also takes the best of iframes to introduce a `<Frame>` component that reminds React’s Suspense and Astro Server Islands (see my [tweet](https://x.com/sebastienlorber/status/1978429126370336966)), letting you defer expensive components to the client. Frames have explicit URLs, can be granularly reloaded after mutations, and payloads are plain old HTML, making them quite easy to debug in the network tab. Unlike React, Remix is able to reconcile both plain HTML and JSX.

Overall, it introduces an interesting model that remains close to React before hooks were introduced, with some major design changes (non-reactive state updates, manual re-renders), and also offers a simpler alternative to React Server Components. As you’d expect from that team, the framework heavily relies on standard web platform primitives (even for the backend), allowing it to run almost everywhere, including Service Workers. Learning Remix 3 will teach you about CustomEvent, EventTarget and AbortController extensively.

![React Native announcements at React Conf](/emails/issues/254/react-native-conf-day.jpg)

**React Native announcements at React Conf**

Last week, Sébastien already posted some hot takes from React Conf, but this conf edition was so packed that he didn’t cover all the great announcements related to React Native. Let’s summarize what we can expect from the latest React Native news.

- **[`<VirtualView>`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/virtualview)** \- the building block for virtualized lists. In cooperation with synchronous events, this component can eliminate blank spaces during fast list scrolling. Detailed explanation you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/live/p9OcztRyDl0?t=10623s).
- **Web Performance API** \- the well-known `performance.mark()` and `performance.now()` are now available in React Native.
- Better Developer Experience coming in the future **React Native 0.83**:
  - **Network Panel** \- a long-missing network inspector now provides information about `fetch()`, `XHR()`, and images, along with metadata and payload inspection.
  - **Performance Panel** \- powered by the new Web Performance API, this provides us with powerful tools for performance profiling and identifying bottlenecks.
  - **Desktop app for React Native DevTools** \- no browser requirement, one window per app, refocusing if re-launched, auto-focus on breakpoint, and saved window arrangements.
- [Evan Bacon announced](https://www.youtube.com/live/p9OcztRyDl0?t=21364s) first class **support for CSS and Tailwind in Expo**.
