Hi everyone!

Well, Dan Abramov is [on holiday](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1666459095979753477), which is probably why there hasn't been much happening this week in our beloved ecosystem 😅.

We do, however, have a few interesting articles and a potential official package for integrating React Server Components with Vite.

[![Colocate your routes into feature folders with Remix Custom Routes](/emails/issues/148/remix-routing.jpg)](https://www.jacobparis.com/content/remix-custom-routes)

**[Colocate your routes into feature folders with Remix Custom Routes](https://www.jacobparis.com/content/remix-custom-routes)**

Explains how Remix v2's flat file routing will improve featured-based code colocation. This can be activated from Remix v1 with a feature flag. With Remix, you can create your own routing conventions: Jacob proposes to improve colocation even further with [remix-custom-routes](https://github.com/jacobparis-insiders/remix-custom-routes) and a naming convention using the `.route.tsx` suffix.

[![Hydration is a tree, Resumability is a map](/emails/issues/148/hydration.jpg)](https://www.builder.io/blog/hydration-tree-resumability-map)

**[Hydration is a tree, Resumability is a map](https://www.builder.io/blog/hydration-tree-resumability-map)**

Gives an interesting mental model for understanding the difference between hydration (React) and resumability (Qwik). With resumability, all components are considered static, and event handlers are the entry point for interactivity. There is no need to traverse a tree (`O(n)`): with resumability, scalability is good, like the lookup in a hashmap (`O(1)`).
