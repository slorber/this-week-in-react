Hi everyone!

While everyone is playing with GPT-4, I'm still reading the React articles for you!

A new `lazy` feature in React-Router looks very useful to avoid waterfalls.

The Rspack bundler in Rust has just been announced.

I'd like to create a referral program for this newsletter. The idea is to encourage you to share it with your friends and reward you if new subscribers join us. Do you have any idea what I can offer?

I thought of:

- +1 subscriber - access to my top 10 React articles ever
- +3 subscribers - access to a well-presented DB of good articles, sorted with tags and rating
- +5 subscribers - a public thank you on Twitter or LinkedIn
- +10 subscribers - your job offer in the newsletter
- +30 subscribers - a course of your choice from Just JavaScript (Dan Abramov), Three.js Journey (Bruno Simon)...
- +50 subscribers - a one-hour React consulting session

It's not easy to choose what to offer 😅. It's easier to manage digital products to get started, but I'm not closed to some physical products (stickers, socks, sneakers, backpack, mug,...).

Can you reply to this email directly to give me your opinion, and tell me what would motivate you the most?

[![Lazy Loading Routes in React Router 6.4+](/emails/issues/138/reactrouterlazy.jpg)](https://remix.run/blog/lazy-loading-routes)

**[Lazy Loading Routes in React Router 6.4+](https://remix.run/blog/lazy-loading-routes)**

[React-Router 6.9](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/releases/tag/react-router%406.9.0) has just been released with a new lazy routes feature that allows to avoid waterfalls, and optimize the loading time of your apps. This is how Remix works, but you can now use this technique on any React-Router based app. Personally I plan to use it on Docusaurus (based on React-Router).

- 👀 [React Flight PR - Add Reply Encoding](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/26360): streaming support for server => client.
- 👀 [Integrating Remix Router with React Transitions](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1634300734094057472): Dan Abramov suggests using `startTransition` in Remix. Suspended components outside `<Suspense>` boundaries should block the transition.
- 🧵 [Dan Abramov - "if you’re not composing GraphQL fragments from multiple components into one query \[...\] you’re missing 80% of the point of GraphQL"](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1634968234821844992): interesting discussions about Relay this week. Although quite intimidating, this GraphQL client has many advantages compared to simpler solutions (colocation, data masking...).
- 🧵 [70% of Docusaurus sites have good Core Web Vitals](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/status/1635661211579580429): my little rant because Docusaurus is often forgotten in the list of React meta-frameworks despite a high usage and good performance.

[SurveyJS](https://surveyjs.io/form-library?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=referral) is a set of open-source JavaScript form libraries that you can easily integrate into your web app. It lets you **create and run multiple forms**, retaining all sensitive data on your servers, or have **your own self-hosted WYSIWYG form builder** that non-tech users can use directly.

You can also **analyze survey results** in custom-built dashboards, save your forms to PDF, or simply **convert them to editable PDF files**. It offers native support for **React and Angular rendering** and total freedom of choice as to the backend, because **any server + database combination is fully compatible**.

[![Rspack](/emails/issues/138/rspack.jpg)](https://www.rspack.dev/)

**[Rspack](https://www.rspack.dev/)**

Official announcement of the Rust bundler from ByteDance, compatible with Webpack but much faster. It will be hard to choose between Rspack and Turbopack, which also announced [upcoming support for Webpack loaders](https://twitter.com/jaredpalmer/status/1619071988181651456). Note that [Unplugin 1.3](https://twitter.com/antfu7/status/1634517321392726017) already supports Rspack and allows to create agnostic bundler plugins. There is no Unplugin Turbopack support yet, but I hope it is planned!
