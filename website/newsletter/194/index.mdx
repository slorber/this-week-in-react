Hi everyone!

I don't know about you, but it's hot here! 🌞\
Only in °C/°F, because this week has been quite cold in terms of news. 🥶\
Many great articles, but no major React release or announcement.

TypeScript saved the week, with the first v5.6 beta, and first-class support coming in Node.js!

Check our partner conf [React Africa](https://react-africa.com/?utm_source=thisweekinreact.com) (🇲🇦 Casablanca - November 29th).\

It's the very first international React conf in Africa! Great speakers have already been announced.

[![React Conf 2024 Talks](/emails/issues/194/reactconf.jpg)](https://conf.react.dev/talks)

🎥 **[React Conf 2024 Talks](https://conf.react.dev/talks)**

The React Conf 2024 talks are finally online, and you can also take a look at the [photos](https://conf.react.dev/photos) and [highlights video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6auCiVoa3c).

We haven’t had any huge React announcement this week, so I thought it would be cool to remind you about all the great upcoming React 19 features thanks to this [great bento slide from Lydia Hallie’s talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJOGzVygGcY). Note that [React 19 is in Release Candidate](https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19) and should be out soon.

- 💸 [Reactile – a new approach to React-based web apps. Create your own views. Let it handle your windows and widgets in a single browser tab](https://www.reactile.net/?utm_source=reactnewsletter)
- 👀 [Rsnext](https://github.com/ScriptedAlchemy/rsnext/commits/rspack): The Rspack team is working on getting Next.js to work under their Rust bundler and shared great progress. The first alphas have been published and can be tried by [aliasing “next” to “rsnext”](https://github.com/substancelabs/rsnext/blob/main/package.json#L11). Also, [Rspack 1.0 beta 1 is out with a new “layers” feature](https://x.com/rspack_dev/status/1818490358319530221), useful for bundling your app in multiple variants and supporting React Server Components. We'll share more about this in the future, once it's ready for prime time.
- 👀 [Enhancing SEO in Flutter Web Projects with Next.js Integration](https://gist.github.com/lcw99/ac1738cb6d5bb032085077605f56665e): Flutter users are desperate to solve the web SEO problem, after Google shared its intention to [deprecate and remove the HTML renderer](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/145954). This awkward workaround is based on Next.js.
- 🐦 [Million Lint - Get parents/children on hover, Locate render triggers](https://x.com/aidenybai/status/1816136004388176010)

- 📜 [React Owner Components](https://reacttraining.com/blog/react-owner-components): Greatly explains the difference between Owner and Parent components. The owner creates the JSX and passes props to it. Client Components cannot own Server Components.
- 📜 [Dissecting Partial Pre Rendering](https://www.nikhilsnayak.dev/blogs/dissecting-partial-pre-rendering): Illustrates how Next.js experimental PPR features takes the best of other rendering strategies with a concrete example: a static course page with dynamic reviews.
- 📜 [Vercel - Flags as Code in Next.js](https://vercel.com/blog/flags-as-code-in-next-js): Explains how the new package `@vercel/flags/next` encodes best practices for integrating feature flags in Next.js, decoupling your code from the underlying flag provider source. Flags are always evaluated server-side, this prevents layout shifts, spinners and disclosing sensitive things to the client. I find it pretty cool that it works with static pages and PPR too: you can precompute as many static variants as there are flag permutations!
- 📜 [Netlify - Live Preview for Gatsby is back (and better) with the new Dev Server](https://www.netlify.com/blog/gatsby-live-preview-with-new-dev-server/): Netlify has a new generic platform primitive to start your framework Dev Server in the cloud.

- 📜 [Creating your own store](https://www.smallrecipesfordisaster.com/posts/local-store): Shows what it takes to create your own store that you connect to React with `useSyncExternalStore`.
- 📜 [Exploring a useState-like API with Zustand: A Fun Experiment](https://www.smallrecipesfordisaster.com/posts/dispatch-zustand): Shows how you can build on top of Zustand so that selectors return a `[state, setState]` tuple.
- 📜 [After a Decade of React, Is Frontend a Post-React World Now?](https://thenewstack.io/after-a-decade-of-react-is-frontend-a-post-react-world-now/): There are good alternatives, but React is still growing, and I believe its growth is still accelerating (🐦 [tweet](https://x.com/sebastienlorber/status/1818233736091271285)).
- 📜 [Battle of the Asyncs](https://www.brenelz.com/posts/battle-of-the-asyncs/): Compares React’s `use` hook with Solid’s `createAsync`, and observes the React solution looks slightly less convenient (even with RSCs).
- 📜 [Why is Zustand a community favorite?](https://www.frontendundefined.com/posts/monthly/zustand-review/): Positive feedback for Zustand, a well-designed, lightweight state manager with selector support.
- 📜 [Boosting performance: Faire’s transition to NextJS](https://craft.faire.com/boosting-performance-faires-transition-to-nextjs-3967f092caaf): Incremental migration from a Kotlin + React SPA to Next.js stack.

[![New Architecture Survey](/emails/issues/194/rn.jpg)](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdrwmX0MvyjEuu6Kx9fH6FufcfftFgf_rqrGASf3hEGD7mupg/viewform)

📊 **[New Architecture Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdrwmX0MvyjEuu6Kx9fH6FufcfftFgf_rqrGASf3hEGD7mupg/viewform)**

We had a lot of news about the New Architecture over the past months, including how it became the new default this year. Now, the teams at React Native and Expo have launched a survey to learn more about your adoption (or what’s keeping you from adopting it). It has 17 questions and should only take a couple of minutes, so I suggest we all help our friends at Meta and Expo out and share our New Arch experience with them. I’m sure they’ll pay us back by using the feedback for even more improvements!
