Hi everyone!

Cyril and Matthieu from [Theodo Apps](https://apps.theodo.com/en?utm_source=thisweekinreact) here 👋.

This week, there are big news from the Remix team. Microsoft also made it easier to try out the TypeScript Go rewrite.

In the React Native world, there were a few minor but interesting releases, and the App.js config starts tomorrow. Seb will have more to tell you about it next week.

Let's dive in!

**[Wake up Remix - The plan for Remix v3](https://remix.run/blog/wake-up-remix)**

This week you might have heard a rumor about [Remix moving on from React](https://x.com/AdamRackis/status/1925646909345058818). Ryan and Michael just published an official post describing the future of Remix.

In a nutshell, React Router will still be fully maintained and a safe bet. In parallel, Remix v3 will be a new framework based on a fork of Preact, so that they control the full stack.

Their goal with Remix v3 is “reimagining what a web framework can be”. The post describes the guiding principles this new framework will follow (optimize for LLMs, build on Web APIs, composition…)
