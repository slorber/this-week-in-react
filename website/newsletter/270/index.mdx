Hello everyone, Krzysztof and Kacper from [Software Mansion](https://swmansion.com/) here 👋

The React Foundation officially launched. Cloudflare rebuilt the whole Next.js in a week using AI. In the meantime, the real Next.js is adding version-matched docs so agents always have context on new and recently updated APIs.

On the React Native side, Hermes is moving beyond mobile: Hermes-node brings the engine to Node.js as a potential V8 swap. CSS Grid is also coming to React Native, and TanStack Router has an early PoC running natively.

Let's dive in\!

**[Still writing tests manually?](https://www.meticulous.ai?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=26q1&utm_content=2nd)**

Notion, Dropbox and LaunchDarkly have found a new testing paradigm - and they can't imagine working without it. Built by [ex-Palantir engineers](https://www.meticulous.ai?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=26q1&utm_content=2nd), Meticulous autonomously creates a continuously evolving suite of E2E UI tests that delivers [near-exhaustive coverage](https://www.meticulous.ai?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=26q1&utm_content=2nd) with _zero developer effort_ - impossible to deliver by any other means. 

It works like magic in the background:

- Near-exhaustive coverage on every test run
- No test creation
- **No maintenance (seriously)**
- Zero flakes (built on a deterministic browser)

**🤨** Curious? [Book in a time to learn more](https://www.meticulous.ai?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=26q1&utm_content=2nd)

[![How we rebuilt Next.js with AI in one week](/emails/issues/270/vinext.jpg)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/vinext/)

**[How we rebuilt Next.js with AI in one week](https://blog.cloudflare.com/vinext/)**

A single Cloudflare engineer rebuilt the Next.js API surface (App Router, RSC, Server Actions, middleware) on Vite in one week using AI for $1,100. Using Oxc/Rolldown, it builds 4.4x and produces 57% smaller bundles. Using the Vite Environment API, it overcomes OpenNext limits, making it compatible with edge runtimes such as Cloudflare Workers.

What started as a bold experiment became [vinext](https://github.com/cloudflare/vinext). It passes 2000+ tests and has 94% test coverage of the Next.js 16 API surface. The `cio.gov` website already runs it in production. It also introduces new concepts such as “Traffic-aware Pre-Rendering”.

This AI-driven port was only possible because Next.js has a well-documented API surface and a comprehensive test suite. A reminder of something TDD practitioners have known for years, but seems more important than ever today: the real value lies in the specification, the test suite, and the API design. Even Guillermo Rauch now believes that [most software will start as markdown spec files](https://x.com/rauchg/status/2026091504280944802) implemented by coding agents. In [Tests Are The New Moat](https://saewitz.com/tests-are-the-new-moat), the author argues that we may see more open-source projects with private test suites: that’s what SQLite is already doing.

[![Hermes-node](/emails/issues/270/hermes.jpg)](https://x.com/tmikov/status/2024609186936660170)

**[Hermes-node](https://x.com/tmikov/status/2024609186936660170)**

Tzvetan Mikov from the Hermes team announced Hermes-node, a CLI version of Hermes compatible with the Node.js API. Since Hermes-node acts as a compatibility layer, it can use original Node.js module implementations without needing to rewrite them \- most work out of the box. You can think of this as simply swapping the V8 engine for Hermes. If combined with compiling Hermes to binary code, this feature could bring significant benefits to the entire Node.js ecosystem.
