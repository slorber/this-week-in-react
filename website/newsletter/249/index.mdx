Hi everyone!

This week is relatively calm in terms of React news, but I’m saving an exciting React core update for next week, so don't miss my next email 👀\!

On the React Native side, we have so many links that it’s a bit overwhelming 😆 And Expo SDK 54 is not even out yet\!

Beware of the massive [npm supply chain attack](https://socket.dev/blog/npm-author-qix-compromised-in-major-supply-chain-attack) affecting very popular packages such as `chalk` and `debug`. To mitigate the impact of compromised dependencies, package managers such as pnpm and Yarn are considering [an option to avoid installing freshly published packages](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9921). This could give enough time for security scanners to report vulnerabilities.

import Support from "../_support.mdx";

**[Shadcn Admin Kit: Your Open-Source Shortcut](https://marmelab.com/shadcn-admin-kit/)**

Do you love how Shadcn/UI puts you back in the driver's seat with components you actually own? Shadcn Admin Kit builds on that same philosophy, but for application logic. 💡

Instead of starting from scratch on auth, data fetching, CRUD, data tables, forms & validation, and error management, Shadcn Admin Kit provides a ready-to-use foundation that fits right into your project.

It's built on the stack you would choose: Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, Shadcn/UI, React Router, TanStack Query, and React Hook Form, all brought together by the same team that built [React-Admin](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/).

Whether you're a startup founder or a lead dev, Shadcn Admin Kit helps you ship fast without sacrificing code quality. No black box or lock-in. Just open-source magic. ✨ [Try it out now](https://github.com/marmelab/shadcn-admin-kit)!

[![An Interactive Guide to TanStack DB](/emails/issues/249/tanstack-db.jpg)](https://frontendatscale.com/blog/tanstack-db/)

**[An Interactive Guide to TanStack DB](https://frontendatscale.com/blog/tanstack-db/)**

A greatly interactive article that shows how React Query can become verbose and complex, and how TanStack DB is designed to fill the gap with new primitives:

- Collections: load large amounts of typed, relational data on the client
- Live Queries: filter/process/join collections at incredible speed, with fewer React re-renders
- Transactional Mutation: perform optimistic updates with less boilerplate and automatic rollbacks

All this without changing your backend endpoints. And you can go even further and adopt a sync engine like ElectricSQL to benefit from real-time synchronization and handle larger datasets.
