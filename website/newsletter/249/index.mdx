**[Shadcn Admin Kit: Your Open-Source Shortcut](https://marmelab.com/shadcn-admin-kit/)**

Do you love how Shadcn/UI puts you back in the driver's seat with components you actually own? Shadcn Admin Kit builds on that same philosophy, but for application logic. 💡

Instead of starting from scratch on auth, data fetching, CRUD, data tables, forms & validation, and error management, Shadcn Admin Kit provides a ready-to-use foundation that fits right into your project.

It's built on the stack you would choose: Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, Shadcn/UI, React Router, TanStack Query, and React Hook Form, all brought together by the same team that built [React-Admin](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/).

Whether you're a startup founder or a lead dev, Shadcn Admin Kit helps you ship fast without sacrificing code quality. No black box or lock-in. Just open-source magic. ✨ [Try it out now](https://github.com/marmelab/shadcn-admin-kit)!
