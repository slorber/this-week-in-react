Hi everyone!

This week we have a good variety of React articles and Next.js is finally adding support for Node.js runtime middleware!

Mobile developers will also discover future plans for React Native, including desktop support from Microsoft. A new sortables drag & drop library should unlock new interactions in your app, considering it's quite hard to build all this yourself.

TypeScript continues to progress with a new beta including a flag to support the newly added native Node.js support, and the upcoming browser support. A polyfill for native browser support is already available!

I'm trying something new this week, splitting the newsletter title keywords with a `|`, following the pattern `React keywords | React Native keywords | Other keywords`. Do you think this is useful?

<!-- truncate -->

import Support from "../_support.mdx";

<Support />

[![Next.js PR - Support for Node.js middleware](/emails/issues/220/nextjs-middleware.jpg)](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/75624)

**[Next.js PR \- Support for Node.js middleware](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/75624)**

A much-awaited feature for the Next.js community. The latest v15.2 canary has a new `experimental.nodeMiddleware` flag letting you opt-in for `runtime: ‘nodejs’`, enabling you to use Node.js APIs in middleware, and remove the constraints of being limited to APIs compatible with the edge runtime.

Vercel middleware has also been [rebuilt from the ground up](https://x.com/galstar/status/1886832573482934706) to support multiple runtimes and run on [Fluid compute](https://vercel.com/blog/introducing-fluid-compute), a new cost-efficient way for Vercel to run serverless functions.
