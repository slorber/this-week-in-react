Hi everyone\! Filip and Krzysztof from [Software Mansion](https://swmansion.com/) here\! 👋

It’s been another challenging week for the React ecosystem. Developers worldwide have been rushing to update their React versions to patch two new vulnerabilities. This serves as a good reminder for all of us to prioritize security during testing.

Fortunately, React Native remains mostly unaffected by these threats, as Server Components aren’t yet widely used in the mobile environment.

We are taking a well-deserved Christmas break 🎄 so this will be our last issue until January 14th.  
Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to everyone\! Thank you for reading our newsletter throughout the year. See you in 2026\! 👋

![React DoS CVE](/emails/issues/263/reactcve.jpg)

[**Denial of Service and Source Code Exposure in React Server Components**](https://react.dev/blog/2025/12/11/denial-of-service-and-source-code-exposure-in-react-server-components)

Another week, another set of React vulnerabilities \- it’s a tough time for the React ecosystem. While these issues are less severe than the last one (allowing Remote Code Execution), they are still serious, and it’s recommended to upgrade React 19 again. Both are related to RSC and Server Actions.

The first ([CVE-2025-55184](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55184)) is a denial-of-service flaw. Attackers can crash your server by sending a payload with a cyclical reference in the React Flight Protocol. This causes React to loop indefinitely until the server times out. The second vulnerability ([CVE-2025-55183](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-55183)) involves code exposure due to a lack of user input validation. Under certain conditions, this can lead to the source code of your implementation being leaked.

The maintainers reacted quite fast, and we have received several patch releases: [React 19.2.3](https://github.com/facebook/react/releases/tag/v19.2.3), [Next.js 16.0.10](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases/tag/v16.0.10), [Vercel/SWR 2.3.8](https://github.com/vercel/swr/releases/tag/v2.3.8)

![RSC Explorer](/emails/issues/263/rscexplorer.jpg)

[**React Server Components Explorer**](https://overreacted.io/introducing-rsc-explorer/)

If recent security headlines had a silver lining, it’s the renewed interest in how React Server Components actually work under the hood. And Dan Abramov showed up just in time with [RSC Explorer](https://tangled.org/danabra.mov/rscexplorer), an interactive tool to help you visualize the wire format and master the mental model.

![Base UI](/emails/issues/263/baseui.jpg)

[**Base UI**](https://base-ui.com/)

Where components are rendered is not the only thing that should receive attention this week, as [Base UI 1.0](https://base-ui.com/) is now stable, marking the official release of the unstyled primitives developed by the original creators of Radix UI, Floating UI and MUI. It’s a significant addition to the "headless" ecosystem, offering a refined alternative to Radix UI or React Aria. All the shadcn/ui components have already been rebuilt to support Base UI ([tweet](https://x.com/shadcn/status/1999530415653113871)).

**VR pushes React Native developers to think more like adaptive-layout designers.** Instead of working with fixed viewports and predictable screen sizes, you’re designing for flexible windows that users can move, resize, and interact with in new ways. In this article, **Jan Jaworski from Callstack** breaks down how to bring mobile experience patterns into VR safely: where they map well and where you’ll need to rethink typography, spacing, accessibility, and interaction models.
