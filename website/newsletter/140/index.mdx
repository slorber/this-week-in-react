Hi everyone!

I'm just back from vacations: we catch up with 2 weeks of news!

A new React Labs post now presents React Forget as a reactivity compiler.

Server Components never cease to surprise. Many related innovations are not yet highlighted outside a few tweets.

For React-Native developers, **[Chain React](https://chainreactconf.com/)** is a great conf in the USA (Portland, May 18-19). They offer us a 10% discount with code `thisweekinreact`.

## ⚛️ React {#react}

[![React Labs](/emails/issues/140/reactlabs.jpg)](https://react.dev/blog/2023/03/22/react-labs-what-we-have-been-working-on-march-2023)

**[React Labs: What We've Been Working On – March 2023](https://react.dev/blog/2023/03/22/react-labs-what-we-have-been-working-on-march-2023)**

An official update from the R&D around React that addresses different topics:

- React Server Components. A nice implementation is already available in Next.js via App Router. RSCs with async/await should also be able to run in a client app. I have the impression they want to unify client/server side model and I think [AsyncContext](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/status/1639183216799100928) will be great for that!
- Asset loading: integration with Suspense for loading CSS, font and images ([more details](https://twitter.com/acdlite/status/1637102880850059264)).
- Document Metadata: first-class support for an API for `<head>` metadata with streaming support.
- React Optimizing Compiler: no longer presented as an auto-memoizing compiler, but as a reactivity compiler. [React Forget has reached a milestone](https://twitter.com/en_JS/status/1641494974893281282), and they are focusing on integration.
- Offscreen Rendering: an innovation I'm really looking forward to, which differentiates React from other frameworks. Meta is testing prerendering on React-Native apps with positive results.
- Transition Tracing: permits to detect slow transitions.
