Hi everyone!

Cyril and Matthieu from [Theodo Apps (formerly BAM)](https://apps.theodo.com/en?utm_source=thisweekinreact) here 👋, standing in for Seb to bring you the latest news from the React and React Native worlds.

This week, shadcn has released a new CLI, and we've noticed other nice things that are currently cooking, like support for the `use()` hook in React Query.

The React Universe Conf starts tomorrow, we're expecting React Native announcements that we will discuss next week!

[![Shadcn introduces a new CLI](/emails/issues/199/shadcn.jpg)](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/changelog)

**[Shadcn introduces a new CLI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/changelog)**

It’s significantly more powerful and flexible:

- `shadcn add` can now install components, themes, hooks, utils, dependencies…
- It supports for multiple React frameworks (Next.js, Remix, Vite, Laravel)
- It can update your tailwind config instead of overriding it
- Components can be imported directly from urls

- 👀 [TanStack Query PR - Add support for `React.use()`](https://github.com/TanStack/query/pull/7988): React Query plans to return a promise that you can `use()`, making it easier to integrate with Suspense in a performant way. It’s more convenient than `usePrefetchQuery` and more parallel than `useSuspenseQuery`.
- 👀 [Remix Route Convention Evolution](https://github.com/brookslybrand/route-convention-evolution): The new `routes.ts` we evoked last week will allow you to skip filesystem-based routing, or simplify using the convention of your choice.
- 🐦 [Next.js 15 may be released soon](https://x.com/feedthejim/status/1829569083777437745) without waiting for React 19 to be stable, and without requiring React 19 for the pages router. It will include major Turbopack improvements.
- 🐦 [Render on Fetch vs Fetch on Render](https://x.com/t3dotgg/status/1829988532489793957): Theo shares a graphical visualization of different React rendering patterns. An associated video is available to deep dive.
- 📜 [Introducing @svg-use](https://fotis.xyz/posts/introducing-svg-use/): Greatly explains how SVG-in-JS (notably SVGR in React) is convenient for theming and distribution, but is not ideal in terms of performance and duplication. The `<use href>` pattern is a good alternative but requires manual plumbing, so the author created a toolchain to automate it.
- 📜 [Build-time Components](https://codehike.org/blog/build-time-components): Greatly illustrated article explains the benefits of React Server Components for MDX users looking to make their content interactive. Client components and build-time Remark/Rehype plugins have limitations, and RSCs offer the best of both.
- 📜 [Using Server Functions and TanStack Query](https://www.brenelz.com/posts/using-server-functions-and-tanstack-query/): TanStack Start is almost ready to use, and has a compelling data fetching approach, with “server fns” integrated with react-query and routing (for prefetching), fully typesafe of course.
