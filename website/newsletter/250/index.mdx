Hi everyone!

As promised, this week is quite exciting, with a very powerful React core `<Activity>` component now in canary, close to becoming stable. We also have a massive Expo SDK 54 release!

npm supply chain attacks continue, this time with a [Shai-Hulud worm](https://www.aikido.dev/blog/s1ngularity-nx-attackers-strike-again) that infects open-source maintainers and automatically publishes compromised packages. Great timing for pnpm 10.16 to come up with a new mitigation option.

[![](/emails/issues/250/activity.jpg)](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/34374)

**[React Core PR \- Release `<Activity>` in Canary](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/34374)**

This exciting new `<Activity>` component can hide a React subtree while preserving its state, and keep rendering it with lower priority. It unlocks new pre-rendering patterns along the way, and could speed up link clicks, tab clicks, back/forward navigation, stack navigation, and more. Read the [reference documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react/Activity), including many use cases with interactive examples..

The long-awaited React component is approaching prime time, has been battle-tested in production by Meta, and is becoming available in React's canary workflow for the community to try out and provide feedback. You may see it appear soon in frameworks that follow the React Canary Workflow, such as Next.js App Router (coming in 15.6), which already leverages it internally in [an experimental back/forward cache feature](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/77992).

- 👀 [Can I use React Server Components today?](https://rsc.krasimirtsonev.com/): Cool resource that tests major frameworks against 12 scenarios to report which RSC-related features are supported. Next.js, Vite, and Waku all have 100% support, while others are close but do not support inline server functions/actions.
- 🐦 [We can't use React hooks conditionally, can we?](https://x.com/sebastienlorber/status/1967505994843611305): You may discover that it’s possible to call hooks conditionally if the condition remains stable over time, and that `useContext()` has always allowed conditional calls despite what ESLint says (but you’d rather use `use()` instead). There’s also a [React Nook](https://iwoplaza.dev/react-nook/) project that lets you call hooks conditionally.
- 🌶 [Cloudflare had a major outage due to an `useEffect` infinite loop triggering API requests](https://blog.cloudflare.com/deep-dive-into-cloudflares-sept-12-dashboard-and-api-outage/): Yep, bad things can happen with this damn dependency array 😅.

- 📜 [Styled-Components maintenance mode: A 40% faster fork](https://www.sanity.io/blog/cut-styled-components-into-pieces-this-is-our-last-resort): Styled-Components is in maintenance mode, and the folks at Sanity forked it to make it much faster thanks to React 18's `useInsertionEffect` hook (among other things). Both Sanity and Linear are using the fork as a temporary solution until they fully migrate to a better one.
- 📜 [Either Tailwind is CSS-in-JS or StyleX isn’t](https://nmn.sh/blog/2025-09-14-tailwind-is-css-in-js): 100% agree on this, zero-runtime CSS-in-JS libraries like StyleX and Linaria are very similar to Tailwind CSS, it’s just the API and tooling that differ, but the outcome is the same.
- 📜 [React Won by Default – And It's Killing Frontend Innovation](https://www.lorenstew.art/blog/react-won-by-default/): A fair criticism of the React-by-default mindset. I agree that more framework diversity could help drive innovation, but I still believe in the technical advantages React has over competitors, for example, that new `<Activity>` component 😇. Let’s not forget that React works on every native platform. This framing doesn’t please everyone, but to me, React doesn’t need to be the best web framework to win; it simply has to be good enough everywhere (and yet it’s still pretty damn good everywhere).

**[Unify Logs, Errors, and Traces in One Place](https://sentry.io/product/logs/?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=paid-community&utm_campaign=logs-fy26q3-logslaunch&utm_content=newsletter-logs-ga-launch-trysentry)**

React logs are now in Sentry.

But they aren’t just any logs, they’re special logs ✨:

- Search logs alongside stack traces and releases
- Trace errors through logs, errors, and performance data in one connected flow
- Cut down on the “guess → check → repeat” cycle

Whether you’re chasing a React error, a slow API query, or a third-party timeout, having all your context in one place means less tab-hunting and more fixing.

- 👀 [React Native PR merged \- Blur filter on iOS](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/52495): Historically, many iOS View style filters are unsupported. This PR adds the missing blur filter natively, with Animated support. We’ll probably get more iOS filters later, considering Meta has opted for the [SwiftUI modifiers solution](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/927) for this PR.

- 🐦 [React Navigation preview \- New `navigation.pushParams()` API](https://x.com/reactnavigation/status/1966196243585196132): Create a navigation entry with new params, without opening a new screen. On a filtered list, you can push your filters and then revert them with the back button.
- 📜 [Apple has a private CSS property to add Liquid Glass effects to web content](https://alastair.is/apple-has-a-private-css-property-to-add-liquid-glass-effects-to-web-content/): Apparently, Apple has a secret way to use liquid glass from `WKWebView` using CSS 🤯. They may be using more webviews than we think\! Interesting theory: “The main reason webviews in apps have such a bad reputation is because you don't notice the webviews that are integrated seamlessly”.
