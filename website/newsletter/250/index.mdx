**[Unify Logs, Errors, and Traces in One Place](https://sentry.io/product/logs/?utm_source=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=paid-community&utm_campaign=logs-fy26q3-logslaunch&utm_content=newsletter-logs-ga-launch-trysentry)**

React logs are now in Sentry.

But they aren’t just any logs, they’re special logs ✨:

- Search logs alongside stack traces and releases
- Trace errors through logs, errors, and performance data in one connected flow
- Cut down on the “guess → check → repeat” cycle

Whether you’re chasing a React error, a slow API query, or a third-party timeout, having all your context in one place means less tab-hunting and more fixing.
