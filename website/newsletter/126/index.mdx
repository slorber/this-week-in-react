Hi everyone!

As you might expect with Thanksgiving, it's a rather quiet week in terms of React news.

It's the end of [Black Friday](https://thisweekinreact.com/black-friday), but some offers are still valid.

If your company is recruiting, I also offer a [**discount of -50% on job offer ads**](https://thisweekinreact.com/sponsor#sponsor-jobs). Don't hesitate to talk to your HR or your manager, it helps me a lot!

**[FlyCode Makes React Apps Editable without coding, Git based](https://bit.ly/3UPwAoJ)**

[FlyCode](https://bit.ly/3wWSi00) (YC S22) makes React web apps editable in minutes so Product and UX teams can iterate and release products faster, so they don't have to wait on (or consume) developer time.

FlyCode reads your regular React code and finds Texts, Images, Design tokens and Analytics event, then it let's non-coders collaborate and edit them and send back a pull request (they don't need access to GitHub!)

- Saves development time
- No code integration, it just reads your code!
- GitHub based, a bot is scanning the code and creates pull requests
- Use your own stack and components
- Retain codebase ownership

You can get started here: [flycode.com/developers](https://www.flycode.com/developers)

## ⚛️ React {#react}

**[Is React going anywhere?](https://www.infoxicator.com/is-react-going-anywhere)**

Interesting reflection from Ruben, after meeting an e-commerce CTO who decided to abandon React for Vanilla JS. Is React really responsible for the poor performance of his app? Is adopting an alternative justified? Will React remain the leader for the next 5 or 10 years?

**[Improving React Interaction Times by 4x](https://www.causal.app/blog/react-perf)**

Causal's cloud spreadsheet app had performance issues. They give us a detailed analysis of the problems and how they solved them via the Chrome profiler. Some issues related to AG Grid (which they patched). Others from their own code mainly related to memoization. They also tried to use Web Workers, but serialization was too expensive.

- 📜 [Progressively enhance the useFetcher hook in Remix](https://sergiodxa.com/articles/progressively-enhance-the-usefetcher-hook-in-remix): little trick to support users with/without JS on Remix's useFetcher API: force a redirect for users without JS. In the same way, it is possible to handle [progressive enhancement on a file upload](https://twitter.com/ebey_jacob/status/1596223682246234113). All this is probably not essential for many apps, but it's good to know that it's possible if needed.

- 📜 [Storybook for full-stack developers](https://storybook.js.org/blog/storybook-for-full-stack-developers/): a good overview of all that the Storybook ecosystem can do for you.

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

**[React Native Core Contributor Summit 2022](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2022/11/22/react-native-core-contributor-summit-2022)**

A good part of the React-Native contributors met at the beginning of September for the React-Native EU conference. They participated in a series of workshops and give us a report. Various topics were discussed, such as the new architecture, the Metro bundler or the release workflow.

**[Shopify - Our Solution for Measuring React Native Rendering Times](https://shopify.engineering/measuring-react-native-rendering-times)**

Presentation of the [react-native-performance](https://github.com/Shopify/react-native-performance) package which allows to generate [field / Real User Monitoring](https://web.dev/lab-and-field-data-differences/) performance reports (in JSON). It integrates easily with React-Navigation. You can send these reports to an analytics dashboard of your choice. This allows you to identify a specific screen that has performance issues in production. It reminds of existing web metrics: Core Web Vitals, TTI, INP and the Vercel/Netlify/Gatsby perf dashboards...
