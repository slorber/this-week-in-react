**[FlyCode Makes React Apps Editable without coding, Git based](https://bit.ly/3UPwAoJ)**

[FlyCode](https://bit.ly/3wWSi00) (YC S22) makes React web apps editable in minutes so Product and UX teams can iterate and release products faster, so they don't have to wait on (or consume) developer time.

FlyCode reads your regular React code and finds Texts, Images, Design tokens and Analytics event, then it let's non-coders collaborate and edit them and send back a pull request (they don't need access to GitHub!)

- Saves development time
- No code integration, it just reads your code!
- GitHub based, a bot is scanning the code and creates pull requests
- Use your own stack and components
- Retain codebase ownership

You can get started here: [flycode.com/developers](https://www.flycode.com/developers)

**[Yuzu is the Best Finance Data API for Frontends](https://www.yuzu.dev/)**

Yuzu is designed to eliminate data engineering for frontend developers building with data sets like:
-   Live Stock, crypto & forex prices
-   Up-to-the minute market news
-   ETF and Mutual fund details

Developers love Yuzu's GraphQL, Websockets, and SQL APIs because it allows them to flexibly grab any data, and focus on building end-user experiences, not on scraping, normalizing and maintaining data sets.

Yuzu's professional-grade data is used by brokerages, analytical platforms, and investing apps ranging from emerging startups to established finance firms.\
Best thing? Anyone can [start for free](https://www.yuzu.dev/pricing)!
