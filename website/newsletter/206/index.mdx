Hi everyone!

Cyril and Matthieu from [Theodo Apps (formerly BAM)](https://apps.theodo.com/en?utm_source=thisweekinreact) here 👋, standing in for Seb to bring you the latest news from the React and React Native worlds.

Big updates this week for the React world! Next.js 15 is officially out with key changes around caching and performance, plus the React Compiler has hit beta — lots to look forward to there.

React Native 0.76 also dropped, with the new architecture now enabled by default and some cool new style props like boxShadow and filter.

We’ve got a bunch of great articles too, from optimizing state with React Cache to a deep dive into React Native's new architecture.

Let’s dive in!

## ⚛️ React {#react}

[![Next.js 15](/emails/issues/206/nextjs-15.jpg)](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-15)

[**Next.js 15**](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-15)

Just in time for Next.js conf, Next.js 15 is officially released. There are no major changes since RC2, just a few stability fixes.

In this v15:

- The caching behavior is flipped with most things (eg `fetch` requests) not cached by default anymore.
- App router uses React 19 RC, pages router stays on React 18
- Using turbopack dev is now recommended (webpack is still supported)
- `@next/codemod upgrade` facilitates migrating

There’s of course a slew of other DX, security and performance improvements.

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

<Todo /> <!-- Add RN release link -->

[**React Native 0.76**](https://reactnative.dev/blog)

React Native 0.76 is out with major updates!

The New Architecture is now enabled by default for better performance, there's a new React Native DevTools for improved debugging, and new style props like `boxShadow` and `filter` for enhanced UI effects (available only with the new architecture). Be aware of some breaking changes: minimum SDK requirements have been raised to iOS 15.1 and Android SDK 24 (Android 7). Time to upgrade and check it out!

- 👀 [React Native PR - Add support for CSS `display: contents`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/46584): Define views that have zero impact on the layout but to which you can still attach event handlers. One possible usage is in `GestureDetector` from `react-native-gesture-handler`, which relies on direct native views to handle touch gestures without affecting layout, to fix issues like automatic collapsing of views in components.
