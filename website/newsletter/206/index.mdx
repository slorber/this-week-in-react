Hi everyone!

Cyril and Matthieu from [Theodo Apps (formerly BAM)](https://apps.theodo.com/en?utm_source=thisweekinreact) here 👋, standing in for Seb to bring you the latest news from the React and React Native worlds.

Big updates this week for the React world! Next.js 15 is officially out with key changes around caching and performance, plus the React Compiler has hit beta — lots to look forward to there.

We’ve got a bunch of great articles too, from optimizing state with React Cache to a deep dive into React Native's new architecture.

Speaking of React Native, v0.76 is coming very soon! A major milestone as it's the first version to activate the New Architecture by default, the culmination of years of work that deserves to be celebrated! 🥳️

The [State of React 2024 survey](https://survey.devographics.com/en-US/survey/state-of-react/2024?source=this_week_in_react) is now open and waiting your answers.

Let’s dive in!

## ⚛️ React {#react}

[![Next.js 15](/emails/issues/206/nextjs-15.png)](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-15)

[**Next.js 15**](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-15)

Just in time for Next.js conf, Next.js 15 is officially released. There are no major changes since RC2, just a few stability fixes. In this v15:

- The caching behavior is flipped with most things (eg `fetch` requests) not cached by default anymore.
- App router uses React 19 RC, pages router stays on React 18
- Using turbopack dev is now recommended (webpack is still supported)
- There are breaking changes such as existing APIs going async, and `@next/codemod upgrade` facilitates the upgrade

There’s of course a slew of other DX, security and performance improvements.
