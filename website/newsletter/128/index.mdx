Hi everyone!

We are entering the Christmas season, and React bloggers are reducing the pace. On my side, I will skip 2 editions.

Still, we have some nice releases and articles to discover. I really liked the article about font layout shifts.

**[React Bricks is a CMS with visual editing based on React components](https://reactbricks.com/?utm_source=this_week_in_react)**

**It's flexible for Developers**: create your own design system using React components, add Visual editing in your JSX and add sidebar controls to edit props like the background color. Choose Next.js, Gatsby or Remix and any CSS framework you like!

**It's easy for Content editors** who can directly edit in a visual way without breaking the design system: much easier than editing abstract entities using gray fields, as in a headless CMS. **And you save time**, as Content editors are autonomous!

**It's enterprise-ready** with Collaboration, Time-machine, Single Sign-on, GDPR-compliant datacenters, Global CDN for optimized images, E-commerce integration, Scheduled publishing and more.

## ⚛️ React {#react}

[![SWR 2.0](/emails/issues/128/swr2.png)](https://swr.vercel.app/blog/swr-v2)

**[SWR 2.0](https://swr.vercel.app/blog/swr-v2)**

New major release for the Vercel data-fetching library. Various improvements listed, including:

- New `useSWRMutation` hook
- Simplified Optimistic UI
- Browser extensions: [SWR DevTools](https://swr-devtools.vercel.app/)
- An imperative preloading API
- Improved React 18 support

[![Vite 4](/emails/issues/128/vite4.png)](https://vitejs.dev/blog/announcing-vite4.html)

**[Vite 4](https://vitejs.dev/blog/announcing-vite4.html)**

Vite is a frontend tool that keeps growing in popularity. This latest version now uses Rollup 3, which greatly simplifies the management of Vite's internal assets. There are now 2 React plugins with different tradeoffs:

- [vite-plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react): esbuild + Babel
- [vite-plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc): replace Babel by SWC in dev, which seems to improve cold start and HMR

[![Codux - Visual IDE for React projects](/emails/issues/128/codux.jpg)](https://dev.to/codux/introducing-codux-15j5)

**[Codux - Visual IDE for React projects](https://dev.to/codux/introducing-codux-15j5)**

Nadav is co-founder of Wix and presents us his new project, a visual IDE for React (and soon other frameworks). It's not about replacing your current IDE, but rather about completing it. Codux allows you to work on a component in isolation, including editing props and styles via a visual interface. The video [Meet Codux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG6i6cCz0P0) should help you understand better. It's a bit like Storybook, but with the ability to edit, and a bidirectional synchronization with your code.
