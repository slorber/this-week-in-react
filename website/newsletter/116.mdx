Hi everyone!

I'm glad to inform you that my first email sent from [ConvertKit](https://thisweekinreact.com/convertkit) has been received by most of you: my email provider migration is successful!

And I'm also very happy with the reception of my [article on `useSyncExternalStore`](https://thisweekinreact.com/articles/useSyncExternalStore-the-underrated-react-api)! Thanks for your many feedbacks, I will try to write more soon. The idea is to have a 100% dedicated email on a specific topic, to learn something new in a short time.

Otherwise, the weekly curation newsletter is back. This is a bit of a special edition: I've put all the interesting links from the last few weeks. There are way too many and I can't comment on them this time 😅 Don't worry, we'll resume the usual format with my comments at the end of September when I get back from vacation!
