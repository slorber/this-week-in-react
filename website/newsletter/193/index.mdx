Hi everyone!

This week the State of React survey results are finally out, and they are full of interesting insights.

I found some great articles on abstractions in React, as well as feedback and case studies from various React and React Native companies.

Astro has released Server Islands, and it looks like a pretty simple but compelling solution to rival with Next.js Partial Prerendering, on which Vercel also published a great article. There's also the Renaissance of Meteor to look forward to, React Aria releases, and a v2 of Gluestack-UI for Universal React Native devs.

**[The Category-Defining React Grid for Your Enterprise](https://1771technologies.com/graphitegrid)**

Data grids are complex components of web applications, but current solutions are inefficient, require a lot of maintenance, and perform poorly. [Graphite Grid](https://1771technologies.com/graphitegrid) transforms the landscape with two key features: retargetable rendering and reactive signal state.

**Graphite Grid** separates grid state from view logic, allowing a single unified state model to support a variety of render targets, declaratively or imperatively. It includes a **DOM and Canvas** renderer, giving developers flexible, high-performance options 🚀.

Graphite Grid is declarative and consistent, leveraging state signals to ensure seamless integration with your application. Designed with **React in mind**, it is the only JavaScript data grid built with React's state management primitives. [Try it now!](https://1771technologies.com/graphitegrid/demo)

[![State of React 2023 - Survey Results](/emails/issues/193/stateofreact.jpg)](https://2023.stateofreact.com/en-US)

**[State of React 2023 - Survey Results](https://2023.stateofreact.com/)**

The very first State of React survey results are finally online. The data was collected in November 2023, and it took a while for the results to be published. It's a great tool for analyzing the trends in our beloved framework ecosystem. And it will become even better next year to see how those trends evolve. Without further ado, here are my picks:

- [The adoption of hooks has been largely successful](https://x.com/JoshWComeau/status/1814292932461306239)
- Very positive signals for React Query, Zustand, Radix UI, React Aria, shadcn/ui, tRPC, Zod
- No clear React framework winner. Next.js is the most popular but has slightly lower retention than Astro and Remix
- React renderer usage shows that React is not only React-DOM. More than 30% use React Native, and 9% use React-Three-Fiber.
- Only 7% have ever used [my favorite underrated hook useSyncExternalStore](https://thisweekinreact.com/articles/useSyncExternalStore-the-underrated-react-api)
- This Week In React is the 5th most popular resource in the "Blogs & Magazines" category (❤️️ thanks!)

The next State of React 2024 survey is [planned for September 2024](https://dev.to/sachagreif/planning-out-the-2024-state-of-surveys-4lb9) and now is the time to get involved in the survey design.

- 📜 [Data Fetching with Server Actions in Next.js](https://www.robinwieruch.de/next-server-actions-fetch-data/): You can use Server Actions to fetch client data using React-Query. There are limitations to consider though: they use POST requests and run sequentially. FYI a "use server" function called outside a transition is not a Server Action, but a [Server Function](https://x.com/sebastienlorber/status/1816096442492051672).
- 📜 [Use useId() Instead Of Hand-Making IDs](https://reacttraining.com/blog/use-useid-instead-of-hand-making-ids): IDs are useful for accessibility, but you’d rather avoid creating them manually if you want to mount a component twice, or have good support for React hydration. To access DOM elements, `useRef` is enough.
- 📜 [Do not pass DTOs to UI components](https://darios.blog/posts/do-not-pass-dtos-to-ui-components): Explain why you’d rather design component props shapes independently, instead of blindly using your backend payloads as props.
- 📜 [DRY – the common source of bad abstractions](https://swizec.com/blog/dry-the-common-source-of-bad-abstractions/): Greatly illustrates how React devs could end up creating the wrong abstractions. React UI libraries learned over the years to not over-abstract and give you great flexibility through composition.

Co-location will help the team iterate faster on production builds (currently 92%-ready!). Turbopack will remain a framework-agnostic standalone bundler: once ready, it will be moved back to a separate repository.

Using Next.js with Server Components and Suspense boundaries makes your app future-proof for selecting the best rendering strategy for each component.

This is an alternative approach to the Next.js model, planning to solve this with React Server Components + Suspense + Partial Pre-Rendering.

**[Use AuthKit with any framework, not just Next.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=237vaK_nYRg)**

Here's a [tutorial that shows you how to set up **AuthKit with any JS framework**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=237vaK_nYRg) in 30 minutes.

- 🏗️ AuthKit is flexible — offering both high-level integrations and low-level SDKs.
- 🔐 It can be used with WorkOS User Management, which is **free up to 1 million MAUs**.
- ✨ Your users, your data. The only requirement for a valid user object is an email address.
- ☄️ Features like roles and permissions, MFA, user impersonation, and bot protection come standard. Don't pay a cent until you hit 1 million MAUs.

**[Gluestack-UI v2 - Universal copy/paste components for Expo/Next](https://gluestack.io/)**

Gluestack-UI offers universal components and patterns for React, Next.js & React Native to copy & paste. The recently released v2 is a major update that focuses on performance optimization, reduced dependencies, and RSC compatibility. It’s based on Tailwind CSS (for web) and NativeWind (for native). Due to its copy & paste approach, upgrading is not as easy as bumping a dependency, but they have a straightforward tutorial and a code mod to help with the upgrade. To give you a glimpse of v2, they even released a little 🐦 [trailer on X](https://x.com/gluestack/status/1813895494005112859).
