🐦 [Vercel reverted all edge rendering back to Node.js](https://x.com/leeerob/status/1780705942734331983)

Vercel’s VP of Product, Lee Rob, explained on X that Vercel is “reverting all edge rendering back to Node.js.” If you’re using Vercel (and probably even if you don’t), you’ll know that Vercel has pushed “edge” as a concept for a long time. One the one hand, edge means that compute is run near to where a user accessing a site hosted on Vercel is located. On the other hand, it also means that this compute is run on an “edge runtime,” which is built on V8 and not on Node.js. While the concept of running compute near to the end users sound appealing, the advantages quickly disappear if data needs to be loaded from a central location (which very often is the case). At the same time, development teams are often struggling to adapt workload to the limited subset of APIs available on the edge runtime. Now it seams Vercel has come to the conclusion that overall, the challenges for developers outweigh the limited benefits, and is therefore reverting to centralized Node.js runtimes. I appreciate their transparency around this! If you want more details, Theo made a [video](https://youtu.be/lAGE-k1Zfrg?si=5SP4hyoFkixTsh-y) about it.

[![React Native 0.74 released, React Native IDE is now in beta](/emails/issues/183/rn183.jpg)](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2024/04/22/release-0.74)

📦 [React Native 0.74 released](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2024/04/22/release-0.74)
  
This week saw the release of React Native 0.74, a major milestone for the community! The latest version makes “bridgeless mode” the default for new projects using the New Architecture (with the next release, 0.75, the New Arch will become the default, too). Both can still be turned off if needed, but they clearly represent the future of React Native, and over the last months especially, A LOT of libraries have added support for both. But there’s more: RN 0.74 includes Yoga 3.0. There are very few breaking changes and deprecations, but it’s still worth checking them out in the [release notes](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2024/04/22/release-0.74).


📦 [React Native IDE is now in beta](https://ide.swmansion.com/)

Another exciting news this week is the closed beta for React Native IDE, developed by the team at Software Mansion. You can now sign up to get early access to the IDE. They also have a landing page up now, and the [docs](https://ide.swmansion.com/docs/getting-started) are publicly available for anyone curious about it.
