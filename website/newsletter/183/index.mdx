Hi everyone!

This week React Native takes the spotlight! But there are also interesting news from Vercel and PRs to take a look at from the React core team.

Earlier this week, I was at React/RN Connection conferences in Paris. It was great to meet some of you there!

The Parisian party is not over. After many years, the great [**dotJS conference**](https://www.dotjs.io/?utm_source=thisweekinreact) is back in Paris on June 27. They already announced great speakers, including Mark Dalgleish, Malte Ubl, Charlie Gerard, James Q Quick, Ben Lesh... Last regular tickets available, get a 10% discount with my code "TWIR".

Due to the conf, I only had today to work on the newsletter. Thankfully my co-author [Benedikt](https://twitter.com/bndkt) took over and did most of the work this week! 🙏

Next week, the newsletter takes a well-deserved break. We'll be back on May 8.

[![Vercel reverted all edge rendering back to Node.js](/emails/issues/183/r183.jpg)](https://x.com/leeerob/status/1780705942734331983)

🐦 [Vercel reverted all edge rendering back to Node.js](https://x.com/leeerob/status/1780705942734331983)

Vercel’s VP of Product, Lee Rob, explained on X that Vercel is “reverting all edge rendering back to Node.js.” If you’re using Vercel (and probably even if you don’t), you’ll know that Vercel has pushed “edge” as a concept for a long time. On the one hand, edge means that compute is run near to where a user accessing a site hosted on Vercel is located. On the other hand, it also means that this compute is run on an “edge runtime,” which is built on V8 and not on Node.js. While the concept of running compute near to the end users sound appealing, the advantages quickly disappear if data needs to be loaded from a central location (which very often is the case). At the same time, development teams are often struggling to adapt workload to the limited subset of APIs available on the edge runtime. Now it seams Vercel has come to the conclusion that overall, the challenges for developers outweigh the limited benefits, and is therefore reverting to centralized Node.js runtimes. I appreciate their transparency around this! If you want more details, Theo made a [video](https://youtu.be/lAGE-k1Zfrg?si=5SP4hyoFkixTsh-y) about it.

- 👀 [React Core PR - React 19 will not patch fetch() anymore!](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/28896): the controversial `fetch()` patch to deduplicate requests in RSCs is now removed from React core. You might see it as a good thing, but keep in mind you will now need to deduplicate requests yourself manually with `React.cache`.
- 👀 [React Core PR - Don't minify symbols in production builds](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/28881): React 19 production builds will preserve variable/function names and should become easier to read/debug. You can still minify it yourself if you want to, but using HTTP gzip compression should be enough to compensate for the extra size.
- 👀 [React Docs PR - Add documentation for ref cleanup function](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/pull/6770): React 19 ref functions can now return a cleanup function (🐦 [preview](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/status/1783108366459375675)). This should also help users using string refs (removed in v19) and classes to migrate thanks to automated codemods.

## 📱 React-Native {#react-native}

[![React Native 0.74 released, React Native IDE is now in beta](/emails/issues/183/rn183.jpg)](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2024/04/22/release-0.74)

📦 [React Native 0.74 released](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2024/04/22/release-0.74)

This week saw the release of React Native 0.74, a major milestone for the community! The latest version makes “bridgeless mode” the default for new projects using the New Architecture (with the next release, 0.75, the New Arch will become the default, too). Both can still be turned off if needed, but they clearly represent the future of React Native, and over the last months especially, A LOT of libraries have added support for both. But there’s more: RN 0.74 includes Yoga 3.0. There are very few breaking changes and deprecations, but it’s still worth checking them out in the [release notes](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2024/04/22/release-0.74).

📦 [React Native IDE is now in beta](https://ide.swmansion.com/)

Another exciting news this week is the closed beta for React Native IDE, developed by the team at Software Mansion. You can now sign up to get early access to the IDE. They also have a landing page up now, and the [docs](https://ide.swmansion.com/docs/getting-started) are publicly available for anyone curious about it.
