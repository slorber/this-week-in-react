Hi everyone!

This week we've had some news about Next.js, which has been getting a lot of criticism recently. Remix is also releasing its new Dev Server with Hot Data Revalidation.

On the React-Native side, the devs are having fun running the latest version on Vision Pro.

Check out [React Jam](https://reactjam.com/?utm_source=thisweekinreact): a contest to create video games in React that starts on 20 July. I'm on the jury.

**[Next.js App Router Update - Top Priorities](https://nextjs.org/blog/june-2023-update)**

The Next.js team shares some context on the new App Router. They've received a lot of criticism lately and are well aware of the bugs and other problems with the current DX. They detail what they're working on in priority:

- Performance: local, build and server runtime
- Bugs and instabilities
- Education and documentation

[![](/emails/issues/150/skew-protection.jpg)](https://vercel.com/blog/version-skew-protection)

**[Vercel - Introducing Skew Protection](https://vercel.com/blog/version-skew-protection)**

New Vercel feature that mitigates the back/front desynchronisation that can occur during a new deployment: requests from state clients can now be routed to the appropriate stale immutable server deployment. Particularly useful for those doing continuous deployment. Available experimentally in Next.js 13.4.7, which will automatically apply the correct HTTP headers.

**[Shadcn UI update - June 2023](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/changelog)**

This collection of Tailwind + Radix components is gaining momentum. The author has just released a major update with a CLI that already offers a great DX, and looks set to add some [impressive AI features](https://twitter.com/shadcn/status/1673055193968287744) in the near future. Kent C. Dodds [explains](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/1673806183935909888) why he adopted it in his Remix stack.
