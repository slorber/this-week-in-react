Hi everyone!

Looks like it's the end of summer already, eh?

This week we had many great releases and articles!\
I'm particularly excited about React Email, which I'd like to use for an upcoming newsletter email template, and for Rspack that I'm adopting for Docusaurus to replace webpack.

- 💸 [Reactile – a new approach to React-based web apps. Create your own views. Let it handle your windows and widgets in a single browser tab](https://www.reactile.net/?utm_source=reactnewsletter)
- 👀 [React Core PR - Schedule prerender after something suspends](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/30800): Remember the [Suspense behavior change controversy](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/29898) delaying the React 19.0 stable release? Andrew has a working implementation to add support for pre-rendering siblings in Suspense components, and this is the first of a series of PR. It introduces a new “pre-rendering” concept that should give us the best of both worlds: keep pre-rendering siblings without blocking the Suspense fallback!
- 👀 [Next.js PR - Apply optimization for unused actions](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/69178): Implements “tree-shaking” of unused server actions found in top-level “use server” files (not inline). This mitigates a security risk reported by the community and avoids exposing endpoints by mistake.
- 👀 [React DevTools PR - Support Server Components in Tree](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/30684): Also adds a `[server]` badge.
- 👀 [React Router PR - Add support for `routes.ts`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11773): Defines a static list of routes, with a possibility to plug in the Remix filesystem convention. The Vite plugin uses this file to create bundles for each route.
- 📖 [TanStack Start new doc - Server Functions](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/start/server-functions): Gives an interesting preview of the upcoming TanStack-Router-based framework. It uses an explicit `createServerFn()` on top of ‘use server’ directives and can give you access to the request context.

- 🗓️ [Next.js Conf](https://nextjs.org/conf) - 🇺🇸 San Francisco & Online - October 24
- 📜 [Error handling and retry with React Server Components](https://edspencer.net/2024/7/16/errors-and-retry-with-react-server-components): To recover from RSC failures, you can present a retry button in your `<ErrorBoundary>`, and call Next.js `router.refresh()` in a transition.
- 📜 [Everything about Google Translate crashing React (and other web apps)](https://martijnhols.nl/gists/everything-about-google-translate-crashing-react): An interactive blog post that greatly explains how Google Translate works and how it interferes with the DOM and React reconciliation, leading to crashes or text not updating. Unfortunately, there is no real solution.
- 📜 [Multipart Namespace Components: Addressing RSC and Dot Notation Issues](https://ivicabatinic.from.hr/posts/multipart-namespace-components-addressing-rsc-and-dot-notation-issues): Explains how components like `<Card.Body>` can cause troubles in the RSC world and prevent tree-shaking. Suggests using named ES exports instead of assigning properties to the default root component. Libs like Chakra and Radix do that.
- 📜 [Implementing React from scratch](https://www.rob.directory/blog/react-from-scratch): Reimplements typing, reconciliation, and hooks. You might discover surprising things along the way, such as the ability to call `useContext` conditionally, or the fact that `useCallback` is similar to `useMemo` returning a callback.
- 📜 [An SSR Performance Showdown](https://blog.platformatic.dev/an-ssr-performance-showdown): You might have seen this benchmark showing React SSR as being slow. It should be updated with more accurate numbers soon. [Dan Abramov PRs](https://github.com/platformatic/ssr-performance-showdown/pull/8) made React SSR x4 faster by enabling production mode, automatic JSX runtime, and upgrading to React 19 RC (Fast JSX).
- 📜 [Never Call new Date() Inside Your Components](https://kyleshevlin.com/never-call-new-date-inside-your-components/): To keep your components testable you’d rather avoid initializing state with impure functions like `new Date()` or `Math.random()`, and pass it as props instead. IMHO you can also use React context.
- 📜 [Consuming a Remix backend from a mobile app or external client](https://www.jacobparis.com/content/remix-external-client): The `?_data` workaround will not work anymore under Remix Single Fetch mode. You’d rather create dedicated API routes for mobile apps and share common code in an abstraction.
- 📜 [Why is CSS-in-JS slow?](https://playfulprogramming.com/posts/why-is-css-in-js-slow): Greatly illustrated articles explain why traditional CSS-in-JS is slow, and how compiled CSS-in-JS makes it faster by avoiding a waterfall chain of steps for the browsers.
- 📜 [Interface Segregation Principle in React](https://alexkondov.com/interface-segregation-principle-in-react/): Explains how to apply this SOLID principle when designing component props and encourages you to use composition. Personally, I also like to leverage TypeScript duck typing and helpers like `Pick` narrow prop types.
- 📜 [Exploring an experimental Micro-Frontend Architecture with Server-Side Rendering using React Server Components](https://dev.to/lazarv/exploring-an-experimental-micro-frontend-architecture-with-server-side-rendering-using-react-server-components-2d0f): An alternative RSC framework introduced an innovative concept of “RSC Delegation”.

- 📦 [Material UI 6.0](https://mui.com/blog/material-ui-v6-is-out/): A great release with many new features and improvements. More importantly, it introduces an opt-in integration with Pigment CSS for static CSS extraction and zero-runtime CSS-in-JS, as a replacement for Emotion, with the ability to support React Server Components and React 19.

[![Rspack 1.0](/emails/issues/198/rspack.jpg)](https://rspack.dev/blog/announcing-1-0)

**[Rspack 1.0](https://rspack.dev/blog/announcing-1-0)**

Rspack is a very fast Rust bundler that is almost 100% compatible with Webpack, including its entire ecosystem of plugins and loaders. Rspack is well suited to being a great choice for many React apps using Webpack that need to bundle faster today. It’s easy to adopt thanks to its compatibility, but also future-proof with [upcoming first-class React Server Components support](https://rspack.dev/blog/announcing-1-0#react-server-components-support). That’s why I’m [migrating Docusaurus to Rspack](https://x.com/sebastienlorber/status/1828696665135431879) by the way. I’d also recommend to take a look at [Rsdoctor](https://rsdoctor.dev/), it’s a great tool that also works with Webpack and will tell you the bottlenecks of your build.
