**[How I Built My Blog](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/how-i-built-my-blog-v2/)**

Josh Comeau shares his experience migrating an advanced blog (100k LOC) from the Next.js Pages Router to the App Router, with mitigated feedback (lower Lighthouse score, slower dev server…). It’s an interesting React read overall, presently presented, interactive, and not limited to Next.js users. Includes many details involving various dependencies: MDX, Shiki, Linaria, Framer-Motion…
