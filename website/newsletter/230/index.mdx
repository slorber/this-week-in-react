**[Product management is broken. Engineers can fix it](https://go.posthog.com/twir-apr16)**

When [PostHog](https://go.posthog.com/twir-apr16-ph) started, they were adamant they would **never hire a product manager**. They wanted engineers to wrestle with hard product problems. Product managers would just get in the way.

They were (partially) wrong. They need product managers and couldn’t have shipped 8+ products or hit their revenue goals without them.

What was needed was a **redefinition of how PMs and engineers work together**, optimized for speed and autonomy. [This post shares their exact playbook](https://go.posthog.com/twir-apr16).
