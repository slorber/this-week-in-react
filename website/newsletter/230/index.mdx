Hi everyone!

This week we have a great Next.js release with significant build speed improvements. I'm also quite excited to see the activity around the upcoming React `<Activity>` component. Many great community blog posts to read too!

React Native also has great releases with the new Expo SDK in beta, and the next version of FlashList in alpha.

**[Product management is broken. Engineers can fix it](https://go.posthog.com/twir-apr16)**

When [PostHog](https://go.posthog.com/twir-apr16-ph) started, they were adamant they would **never hire a product manager**. They wanted engineers to wrestle with hard product problems. Product managers would just get in the way.

They were (partially) wrong. They need product managers and couldn’t have shipped 8+ products or hit their revenue goals without them.

What was needed was a **redefinition of how PMs and engineers work together**, optimized for speed and autonomy. [This post shares their exact playbook](https://go.posthog.com/twir-apr16).

[![Next.js 15.3](/emails/issues/230/nextjs.jpg)](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-15-3)

**[Next.js 15.3](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-15-3)**

A new minor version of Next.js is out, with highlights:

- Turbopack for builds (alpha): Faster production builds passing 8000+ tests (99%)
- Community support for Rspack (experimental): Alternative bundler with Webpack compatibility
- Client Instrumentation hook: Early monitoring and analytics setup
- Navigation hooks: Control routing with `onNavigate` and `useLinkStatus`
- TypeScript plugin improvements: Improved support for large codebases

It’s great to see Next.js improving with faster bundling with Turbopack for builds, and opening up to Rspack as an alternative to Webpack. Both have different tradeoffs and use cases.

- 👀 [React Types PR \- `unstable_Activity`](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/72454): There’s a lot of `<Activity>` activity lately, including TypeScript typedefs added. This upcoming component, previously named `<Offscreen>`, has been [mentioned in React Labs updates since 2022](https://react.dev/blog/2022/06/15/react-labs-what-we-have-been-working-on-june-2022#offscreen), and may soon be ready for prime time? This low-level primitive is particularly exciting for frameworks to fully leverage Concurrent React.
- 👀 [Next.js PR \- Experimental bfcache \- Restore state with `<Activity>`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/77992): Unsurprisingly, Next.js starts experimenting with the `<Activity>` component above, by implementing a back/forward cache feature that allows pressing the browser back button to instantly transition to the previous page while restoring its former React state. In the future, Next.js (and other React/RN frameworks too) will likely implement speculative pre-rendering: React could start rendering a target page as soon as you hover a link, even before you click it.
- 👀 [React Core PR \- Add Suspensey Images behind a flag](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/32819): An upcoming React feature could help ensure all images have loaded before transitioning to a new page. The rollout plan is still unclear: it might come in a minor or major.
